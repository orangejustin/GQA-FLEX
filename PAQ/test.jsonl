The primary goal is to prevent pressure ulcers through various means including the use of air-fluidized or foam mattresses, improving the nutritional status of the patients, proper placing of patients in bed, changing position frequently, and treatment of the underlying diseases. A treatment plan involves the removal of all devitalized tissue that may serve as a reservoir for bacterial contamination (debridement). Also, it involves dressing by utilizing hydrogels, hydrocolloids, or saline-moistened gauze to enable granulation tissue to grow and the wound to heal. Treatment of underlying infection by topical or systemic antibiotic medications might be needed to help in the healing process, but tissue culture should be obtained before selecting the accurate drug. Pain and discomfort can be controlled by analgesics. A dietary consult should be made to ensure that the patient is receiving adequate calories. When possible, the patient should be out of bed to chair, and physical therapy should be consulted for ambulation and/or exercise. Wound care specialty trained nurses should assist in dressing changes, debridement of wounds, and provide close followup care. The nurses should also assist the clinician in the education of the patient and family. Pressure ulcers are very difficult to treat, it is crucial that the nurses and clinicians work together as an interprofessional team to provide the very best care including treatment, monitoring, and followup care.

Glucagon, at least after im administration, induces clear increase in either GH or ACTH and F levels but its effect on somatotroph and corticotroph secretion in obesity has never been studied. In 7 patients with abdominal obesity (OB, aged 24-42 yr, BMI: 29.1-43.9 kg/m2, waist/hip ratio [WHR]: 0.86-1.00) we studied the GH, ACTH and F responses to the im administration of glucagon (0.017 mg/kg at 0 min). The results in OB were compared with those in a group of 6 age-matched controls normal subjects (Ns aged 26-32 yr, BMI 19.7-22.5 kg/m2). In Ns glucagon administration induced clear increase in GH (peak vs baseline, mean+/-SE: 11.6+/-3.4 vs 3.3+/-0.7 microg/l, p&lt;0.02), and ACTH (52.9+/-15.2 vs 19.0+/-1.5 pg/ml, p&lt;0.02) levels which peaked at +150 and +165 min, respectively.

The 4-aryl-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-2-butenoic acids and their isosteric tetrazoles are among an emerging class of aryl beta-diketo (ADK)-based agents which exhibit potent inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN)-catalyzed strand transfer (ST) processes, while having much reduced potencies against 3'-processing (3'-P) reactions. In the current study, L-708,906 (10e) and 5CITEP (13b), which are two examples of ADK inhibitors that have been reported by Merck and Shionogi pharmaceutical companies, served as model ADK leads. Structural variations to both the \"left\" and \"right\" sides of these molecules were made in order to examine effects on HIV-1 integrase inhibitory potencies. It was found that a variety of groups could be introduced onto the left side aryl ring with maintenance of good ST inhibitory potency. However, introduction of carboxylic acid-containing substituents onto the left side aryl ring enhanced 3'-P inhibitory potency and reduced selectivity toward ST reactions. Although both L-708,906 and 5CITEP show potent inhibition of IN in biochemical assays, there is a disparity of antiviral activity in cellular assays using HIV-1-infected cells. Neither 5CITEP nor any other of the indolyl-containing inhibitors exhibit significant antiviral effects in cellular systems.

Treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES SCLC) or extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (EPSC) is typically palliative. We set out to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall long-term survival of ES SCLC and EPSC patients, physiologically aged &lt; or = 60 years, responding to first-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose combination alkylating agents with hematologic stem cell support. Patients in first-line chemotherapy response underwent stem cell collection (marrow, peripheral blood progenitor cells, or both) followed by high-dose therapy with 1 of 2 regimens: CBP (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine) or ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) with or without etanidazole. Involved-field radiotherapy was given to selected patients with oligometastatic disease distributed in sites allowing for reasonable radiation ports, and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy was given upon recovery to patients in complete response (CR) or near-CR. A total of 36 patients were treated. Of 29 patients with ES SCLC, 6 (21%) had achieved CR, 18 near-CR, and 5 partial response prior to high-dose therapy. Of 7 patients with EPSC, 3 (43%) had achieved CR, 3 had achieved near-CR, and 1 had progression of disease prior to high-dose therapy. Thirteen ES SCLC patients received high-dose CBP. Of the remaining 23 patients with SCLC or EPSC, 17 were treated with ICE and 6 with ICE plus etanidazole, a hypoxic cell sensitizer. Treatment-related mortality was 11% (4 of 36 patients). For all patients, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 5 months. The 2- and 5-year survivals after intensification were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%-31%) and 9% (95% CI, 3%-27%), respectively. Of the 30 patients in or near CR prior to high-dose therapy, 5 remain continuously progression-free (2 ES SCLC, 3 EPSC) for a median of 55 months (range, 1-96 months) after high-dose therapy. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with more favorable EFS were the use of a more aggressive induction regimen (ICE), and the EPSC histology. These factors were also associated with more favorable overall survival. Other factors associated with more favorable overall survival were the use of short induction therapy (&lt; or = 4 cycles) and younger age (&lt;50 years). Except for high-dose ICE with etanidazole, the use of high-dose systemic therapy in ES SCLC and EPSC was associated with low treatment-related morbidity and mortality over the past 5 years. Late complications were infrequent, and most patients returned to full-time work and activity, barring disease recurrence. Nonetheless, few patients with ES SCLC have progression-free long-term survival. We conclude that high-dose therapy is not indicated as an approach for ES SCLC, except as part of an investigative trial.

Because force from the small intrinsic muscles of the hand is applied to the extensor hood distal to the fulcrum of the metacarpophalangeal joints, the muscles flex these joints (Fig. 7.103B). Simultaneously, the force is transferred dorsally through the hood to extend the interphalangeal joints. This ability to flex the metacarpophalangeal joints, while at the same time extending the interphalangeal joints, is entirely due to the intrinsic muscles of the hand working through the extensor hoods. This type of precision movement is used in the upstroke when writing a t (Fig. 7.103C).", "answer": "The lumbrical, interossei, abductor digiti minimi, adductor pollicis, and abductor pollicis brevis muscles contribute to hand movements by flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints and extending the interphalangeal joints through their attachment and force application to the extensor hoods.

This study evaluated protection against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) afforded by static filter-top caging when automatic watering was used with conventional husbandry techniques as a labor-saving option. We fitted one side of a double-sided 72-cage rack with valves external to each cage; cages on the other side were fitted with shielded internal valves. More than 50% of the mice were breeding mice, and 30% were genetically altered. One cage of mice on each shelf on both sides of the rack was infected with MHV-A59. Each row of cages also contained one standard cage (no filter top) of uninoculated mice at various distances from the infected cage. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after infection of the mice in the test cages, uninoculated mice in 22 cages were tested by serology, and at 8 weeks the uninoculated mice in 54 cages were tested by serology and those in 24 cages were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fecal samples to assess transmission of infection. At 8 weeks post-infection, mice in one uninoculated cage (which had a filter top and an internal valve and was adjacent to a cage of inoculated mice) was seropositive. Examination of feces by PCR revealed MHV shedding in mice in nine uninoculated cages (three lacking filter tops but with internal valve cages; two with filter tops and internal valve cages and adjacent to non-filter top cages; two non-filter-top cages with external valves; and two filter-top cages with external valves, of which one was adjacent to a non-filter-top cage). Routine husbandry using either automatic water valve system prevented (with one exception) transmission among filter-top cages for at least 6 weeks. The 10 cages where transmission occurred were non-filter-top cages (n = 5) and filter-top cages adjacent to non-filter top, infected, or sentinel cages (n = 5). These results suggest that the use of filter top-caging with automatic watering may limit MHV transmission for 6 weeks, during which immunocompetent mice would be expected to clear the virus.

A series of N(6)-alkyl-2-alkynyl derivatives of adenosine (Ado) have been synthesized and evaluated for their affinity at human A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors and for their potency at A(2B) adenosine receptor subtypes. The corresponding 2-(1-alkynyl) derivatives of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and Ado are used as reference compounds. Binding studies demonstrated that the activities of 2-alkynylAdos were slightly increased for the adenosine A(1) receptor and slightly decreased for both A(3) and A(2B) subtypes compared to those of their corresponding NECA derivatives, whereas the A(2A) receptor affinities of the two series of nucleosides were similar. The presence of a methyl group on N(6) of the 2-alkynyladenosines, inducing an increase in affinity at the human A(3) receptor and a decrease at the other subtypes, resulted in an increase in A(3) selectivity. In particular, 2-phenylethynyl-N(6)-methylAdo (8b) showed an A(3) affinity in the low nanomolar range (K(i)(A(3)) = 3.4 nM), with a A(1)/A(3) and A(2A)/A(3) selectivity of about 500 and 2500, respectively. These findings motivated us to search for the preparation of new selective radioligands for the A(3) subtype; hence, a procedure to introduce a tritiated alkylamino group in these molecules was carried out. As far as the potency at the A(2B) receptor, the type of 2-alkynyl chain and the presence of the ethylcarboxamido group on the sugar seem to be very important; in fact, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynylNECA [(S)-PHPNECA, 1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM] proved to be one of the most potent A(2B) agonist reported so far. On the other hand, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-N(6)-ethylAdo (9e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.73 microM) showed a significantly increase of potency at the A(2B) subtype in comparison with the N(6)-methyl, N(6)-isopropyl, and the unsubstituted adenosine derivatives, although it resulted in being less potent than (S)-PHPNECA (1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM). These observations suggest that the introduction of an ethyl group in the N(6)-position and an ethylcarboxamido substituent in the 4'-position of (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyladenosine could lead to a compound endowed with high potency at the A(2B) receptor.", "answer": "3.4 nM", "covered": false}

Therefore, it is important to predict the disease outcome before starting H. pylori eradication. We investigated the usefulness of flow cytometry, quantifying CD19- and CD20-positive B lymphocytes in MALT lymphoma tissue, for predicting the disease outcome after H. pylori eradication. Tissue specimens from 14 patients with H. pylori-positive low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma were examined by histology, Southern blotting, and flow cytometry before therapy. Serum levels of soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor were also measured. The relationship between the data and the prognosis after H. pylori eradication was analyzed. Remission occurred in 10 of the 14 patients. The condition in the 4 remaining patients deteriorated even after H. pylori eradication. The percentages of CD19- and CD20-positive cells in MALT lymphoma tissue from the patients in remission were both significantly lower than those in the tissue from patients not in remission. Indeed, 4 of the 5 patients in whom both CD19- and CD20-positive cells accounted for more than 50% of the total number of lymphocytes had gastrectomy, whereas all patients in whom both CD19- and CD20-positive cells accounted for less than 50% of the total number of lymphocytes achieved remission. Although immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was present in all patients operated on, there were also 6 patients whose MALT lymphoma was ameliorated in spite of the presence of gene rearrangement. The serum level of soluble IL-2 receptor was in the normal range in all patients tested.

High-titer alphavirus vectors have been generated for efficient gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Studies on CNS infection via intranasal and peripheral injections with virulent and avirulent replication-competent Semliki Forest virus (SFV) strains has demonstrated the potential of gene delivery. Replication-deficient alphavirus particles have shown high local transgene expression of a transient nature in rodent brain. Alphavirus vectors have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in infected human tumor cell lines and SFV vectors expressing interleukin-12 resulted in tumor regression in a B16 murine melanoma model. Repeated SFV injections led to stronger anti-tumor effects without immunogenic response detected against SFV. It has also been shown that intra-tumoral SFV-injections into nude mice with implanted human lung carcinomas led to tumor regression. Likewise, injection of replicative SFV-LacZ RNA resulted in tumor response as well as prophylactic protection against tumor formation. Alphaviruses have also showed potential in vaccine production. Additionally, modifications in the envelope structure of Sindbis virus resulted in substantial change in host range and demonstrated the feasibility of targeting alphavirus vectors. Moreover, SFV has been used as an expression vector for the generation of high-titer retrovirus-like particles. Recent alphavirus vector development has introduced novel non-cytopathogenic vectors, tightly temperature-regulated vectors as well as replication-persistent forms that should prolong the duration of expression. Alphavirus vectors can therefore be considered as highly potential gene delivery vehicles for future gene therapy applications, especially where only short-term expression is required, or even preferred.", "answer": "High-titer alphavirus vectors, particularly those expressing interleukin-12, play a role in inducing tumor regression in a B16 murine melanoma model by promoting apoptosis in tumor cells.", "covered": false}

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_315_1", "question": "Which cytokines are involved in the adaptive host response to suppress Salmonella growth in the early phases of infection?", "doc_chunk": "Immunity to systemic Salmonella infections. Salmonella infections are a serious public health problem in developing countries and represent a constant concern for the food industry. The severity and the outcome of a systemic Salmonella infection depends on the \"virulence\" of the bacteria, on the infectious dose as well as on the genetic makeup and immunological status of the host. The control of bacterial growth in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the early phases of a Salmonella infection relies on the NADPH oxidase-dependent anti-microbial functions of resident phagocytes and is controlled by the innate resistance gene Nramp1. This early phase is followed by the suppression of Salmonella growth in the RES due to the onset of an adaptive host response. This response relies on the concerted action of a number of cytokines (TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12, IL18, and IL15), on the recruitment of inflammatory phagocytes in the tissues and on the activation of the recruited cells. Phagocytes control bacterial growth in this phase of the infection by producing reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) generated via the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Clearance of the bacteria from the RES at a later stage of the infection requires the CD28-dependent activation of CD4+ TCR-alphabeta T-cells and is controlled by MHC class II genes. Resistance to re-infection with virulent Salmonella micro-organisms requires the presence of Th1 type immunological memory and anti-Salmonella antibodies. Thus, the development of protective immunity to Salmonella infections relies on the cross-talk between the humoral and cellular branches of the immune system.", "answer": "TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12, IL18, IL15.", "covered": false}

Twenty-five dyspeptic patients (6 men, 19 women) with a mean age of 64.8 years (range, 25-80 years) were studied. The patients received a liquid test meal, containing 100 mg of 13C-acetate and 12g of lactulose, while they were in the sitting position after an overnight fast. Breath samples were collected at 10-min intervals of 120 min and both 13CO2 and hydrogen (H2) levels were measured. Subsequently, H2 concentrations were measured at 30-min intervals, for a total of 240 min. The results of gastric emptying were expressed as the time of peak 13CO2 excretion. OCTT was defined as the period between the ingestion of lactulose and a H2 peak rise of 5 ppm above the baseline value. The onset of H2 enrichment in the breath began at 90-110 min, whereas 13CO2 levels increased from the beginning, with peak enrichment values being reached after 60-80 min.

Over the last decade, increasing attention has been paid to the development of systems to deliver drugs for long periods at controlled rates. Some of these systems can deliver drugs continuously for over one year. However, little effort has been given to developing systems for the controlled release of nucleic acids. Recently, a novel gene transfer method which allows prolonged release and expression of plasmid DNA in vivo in normal adult animals was established. In this system, a biocompatible natural polymer such as collagen or its derivatives acts as the carrier for the delivery of DNA vectors. The biomaterial carrying the plasmid DNA was administered into animals and, once introduced, gradually released plasmid DNA in vivo. A single injection of plasmid DNA/biomaterial produced physiologically significant levels of gene-encoding proteins in the local/systemic circulation of animals and resulted in prolonged biological effects. These results suggest that the biomaterials carrying plasmid DNA may enhance the clinical potency of plasmid-based gene transfer, facilitating a more effective and long-term use of naked plasmid vectors for gene therapy. Furthermore, the biomaterials can be removed surgically, minimizing the effect of gene products if some unexpected side effects should be observed after application.

In two intervals when no firing was undertaken for 3-4 months, the blood lead concentrations either decreased towards a baseline value in the case where only Cu-jacketed bullets were fired or remained elevated when dominantly cast lead bullets were fired. The propellants contained &lt;2 ppm Pb and contribute negligibly to blood lead. The isotopic composition of the primer used for all bullets was consistent with a source from the US. The bullets were of different materials and made in Australia and the US, with lead from sources of different geological age and hence different isotopic signatures. Variations in blood lead concentration and isotopic composition appear most strongly influenced by the bullets.

A promising approach in adoptive immunotherapy is based on the induction of a specific cellular anti-tumor response by antigen-specific, cytolytic T cells. Due to difficulties in isolating tumor-specific T cells in sufficient amounts, it was proposed to graft cytolytic T cells with an antigen-specific, recombinant T cell receptor. The antigen binding domain of the receptor consists of a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) that is derived from a monoclonal antibody and binds to a tumor associated antigen. The intracellular signalling domain is derived from the cytoplasmic part of a membrane bound receptor to induce cellular activation, e.g., the Fc epsilon RI receptor gamma-chain or the CD3 zeta-chain. By use of this type of recombinant receptor, the strategy combines the advantages of MHC-independent, antibody-based antigen binding with efficient T cell activation upon specific binding to the receptor ligand. The modular composition of the receptor, moreover, facilitates modification of both the antigen binding and signalling properties. Accordingly, we and others have generated a panel of recombinant T cell receptors with specificities for malignantly or virally transformed cells. Receptor grafted effector cells were demonstrated to mediate a highly efficient immune response towards antigen expressing target cells. However, little is known about the impact of the recombinant receptor modules on recognition of highly heterologous target antigens and on cellular activation in a complex immunological context. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the generation and function of recombinant immunoreceptors and discusses the limitations and perspectives of the methodology for use in cellular immunotherapy.", "answer": "The advantages of the modular composition of the recombinant T cell receptor include MHC-independent antigen binding, efficient T cell activation, and the ability to modify antigen binding and signaling properties for tailored immunotherapy.", "covered": false}

Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed a standard or a Zn-deficient diet for 4 weeks, we examined whether Zn deficiency affects systemic blood pressure (BP) levels in a genetically hypertensive state through a fall in the activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet had a progressive increase in systolic BP during the dietary conditioning. Consequently, SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet exhibited significantly increased levels of systolic BP by 2 weeks after the start of dietary treatment when compared with SHR fed a standard diet. Similarly, levels of basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) observed at the end of dietary treatment were SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet &gt; SHR fed a standard diet. Administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME, caused an increase in MAP levels in the two groups of rats, demonstrating the involvement of the vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), in the regulation of systemic BP in a genetically hypertensive state. The expression of endothelial (e) NOS mRNA and protein in the thoracic aorta paralleled basal MAP levels in the two groups of rats, suggesting the counter-regulation of eNOS against the developed hypertensive state in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet. On the other hand, administration of the superoxide scavenger, tempol (a SOD mimetic compound), led to a decrease in MAP levels in the two groups of rats, indicating the participation of the oxygen free radical, superoxide, in an increase in systemic BP in a genetically hypertensive state. As reported recently, the mechanism involved is due likely to a decrease in the action of the vasodilator, NO, based on the formation of peroxynitrite coming from the non-enzymatic reaction of superoxide and NO. In addition, tempol treatment completely restored MAP levels in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet to levels comparable to those observed in SHR fed a standard diet, indicating that a further increase in systemic BP levels seen in SHR fed a Zn-deficient vs. a standard diet is presumably brought by a reduction in the action of the vasodilator, NO, resulting from an increase in the action of superoxide. The activity of the superoxide scavenger, Cu/Zn-SOD, in the thoracic aorta was significantly decreased in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet relative to SHR fed a standard diet. It appears that a decrease in the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD observed in the thoracic aorta of SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet at least in part plays a role in an increase in the action of superoxide in this model. Thus, Zn deficiency may be a factor to develop genetic hypertension presumably through the oxidative stress caused by superoxide.", "answer": "Zinc deficiency aggravates hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats by increasing systemic blood pressure levels, primarily through a reduction in Cu/Zn-SOD activity leading to increased superoxide action and decreased nitric oxide availability.", "covered": false}

This paper describes a hypothesis related to the neurochemical background of sleep-waking mental activity which, although associated with subcortical structures, is principally generated in the cerebral cortex. Acetylcholine, which mainly activates cortical neurons, is released at the maximal rate during waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreaming stage. Its importance in mental functioning is well-known. However, brainstem-generated monoamines, which mainly inhibit cortical neurons, are released during waking. Both kinds of influences contribute to the organized mentation of waking. During slow wave sleep, these two types of influence decrease in intensity but maintain a sufficiently high level to allow mental activity involving fairly abstract pseudo-thoughts, a mode of activity modelled on the diurnal pattern of which it is a poor reply. During REM sleep, the monoaminergic neurons become silent except for the dopaminergic ones. This results in a large disinhibition and the maintained dopamine influence may be involved in the familiar psychotic-like mental activity of dreaming. Indeed, in this original activation-disinhibition state, the increase of dopamine influence at the prefrontal cortex level could explain the almost total absence of negative symptoms of schizophrenia during dreaming, while an increase in the nucleus accumbens is possibly responsible for hallucinations and delusions, which are regular features of mentation during this sleep stage.", "answer": "Monoaminergic neurons (except for the dopaminergic ones).", "covered": false}

Cardiac arrest in children outside the hospital is associated with high mortality rates. Recent investigations have suggested that the use of advanced life support (ALS) measures by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel may decrease survival. These studies have used the pediatric Utstein style of defining ALS and basic life support (BLS) measures. The pediatric Utstein style defines BLS as \"an attempt to restore effective ventilation and circulation\" using noninvasive means to open the airway but specifically excludes the use of bag-valve-mask devices. Advanced life support is defined as the \"addition of invasive maneuvers to restore effective ventilation and circulation.\" The authors of the study described below believe that using this definition would categorize some patients into an ALS group who would otherwise be categorized as having received BLS (i.e., \"bag-valve-mask only\"). To compare survival rates among children receiving BLS or ALS following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using amended definitions of prehospital life support measures.

Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus capable of causing severe respiratory illness in immunocompromised individuals, resides in macrophages during mammalian infection. Previous studies suggest that siderophore-mediated iron transport may be important for the acquisition of iron from transferrin while the organism resides in macrophages. However, iron is also present as hemin in the intracellular environment of the macrophage and may serve as a major source of iron during infection. Thus the ability of H. capsulatum to use hemin and heme-containing compounds was examined. Histoplasma capsulatum G217B was iron-starved by adding the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate to the culture. The addition of 10 microM hemin in the presence of deferoxamine mesylate restored growth to the levels seen in the absence of the chelator. Histoplasma capsulatum was also cultivated in an iron-limited, chemically defined medium without the addition of chelators and it was determined that the organism could also use hemoglobin as a sole source of iron. The method of iron internalization from heme was examined by measuring hemin binding to the yeast-cell surface. The ability of H. capsulatum to bind hemin was related to the nutritional status of the cells. Cells grown under iron-limited conditions bound more heme to the cell surface than did cells grown in medium without chelator. Pretreatment of iron-starved cells with proteinase K eliminated the ability of the organism to bind hemin. Additionally, the pre-incubation of iron-starved H. capsulatum with hemin eliminated the ability of these cells to remove hemin from the solution, although pre-incubation of cells with the iron-free form of hemin, protoporphyrin IX, only modestly affected the ability of the organism to bind hemin. These results suggest that H. capsulatum uses hemin as a sole source of iron and that one mechanism of iron acquisition involves a cell-surface receptor for hemin.", "answer": "H. capsulatum utilizes hemin as a source of iron during infection, binding it to cell-surface receptors especially under iron-limited conditions.", "covered": false}

This makes these devices more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. [2] In the United States, there has been an increased use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) since 1995. This use has continued to increase from year to year, with 14% of women who use contraception choosing to use a form of LARC. [1] There has also been a decrease in the number of unplanned pregnancies with the increased use of LARC. [1] Additionally, there are many benefits of IUDs, including efficacy, ease of use, reversible nature, and patient satisfaction, especially with time commitment for long-term use and cost.

The aminosalicylate balsalazide is a prodrug which is metabolised by bacterial azo reductases in the colon to release its therapeutically active moiety mesalazine [mesalamine (US) or 5-aminosalicylic acid] and an inert carrier molecule. The systemic absorption of balsalazide and its metabolites is not required for the therapeutic efficacy of the drug, and has been demonstrated to be limited. Data from well designed trials with a duration of 8 to 12 weeks show that oral balsalazide 6.75 g/day is as effective as (two trials) or more effective than (one trial) oral delayed-release (pH-dependent) mesalazine 2.4 g/day and appears to be as effective as oral sulfasalazine 3 g/day in the treatment of active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. In addition, balsalazide appears to have a faster onset of action than mesalazine. Furthermore, balsalazide was as effective as delayed-release mesalazine (dosages used were 1.2 and 1.5 g/day, where 1.6 g/day is recommended) and oral sulfasalazine 2 g/day (recommended dosage) in the prevention of relapse in ulcerative colitis in remission after 6 to 12 months of treatment; the balsalazide dosage was 3 g/day versus mesalazine and 2 g/day versus sulfasalazine. Although not well established, additional benefits may be achieved with balsalazide dosages up to 6 g/day. Data from well designed, 2- to 12-month trials show that balsalazide is well tolerated by patients with ulcerative colitis in both acute and maintenance indications, and is better tolerated than standard formulations of sulfasalazine at therapeutically relevant dosages.

Batch experiments were made in order to investigate the kinetics of abiotic decolorization of the reactive mono-azo dye C.I. Reactive Orange 96 (RO 96) with sulfide, with varying pH. The decolorization of RO 96 by sulfide under the exclusion of O2 corresponded to first-order kinetics with respect to both dye and sulfide concentration. The decolorization of RO 96 with sulfide at neutral pH (7.1) was advantageous compared with that at pH for 4.1, 6.3, and 6.5.

We present morphological analyses of verb inflections produced by 15 Spanish-speaking children (age range: 1;7 to 4;7) taken from longitudinal and cross-sectional samples of spontaneous speech and narratives. Our main observation is the existence of a dissociation between regular and irregular processes in the distribution of errors: regular suffixes and unmarked (non-alternating) stems are over-extended to irregulars in children's inflection errors, but not vice versa. We also found that overregularization errors at all ages are only a small minority of the children's irregular verbs, that the period of overregularization is preceded by a stage without errors, and that the onset of over-regularizations is connected to the emergence of obligatory finiteness markings. These findings are explained in terms of the dual-mechanism model of inflection.", "answer": "The dual-mechanism model explains the findings by suggesting that the dissociation between regular and irregular verb processes, where regular suffixes are mistakenly applied to irregular verbs (overregularization), reflects separate cognitive mechanisms for handling regular and irregular verb inflections.

The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of ependymoma has diminished recently because (1) chemotherapy fails to delay radiation therapy for a meaningful period of time; (2) tumors that progress during chemotherapy do not respond as well to subsequent irradiation; and (3) the combination of chemotherapy and irradiation does not improve overall survival. However, chemotherapy may make residual tumor more amenable to a second resection. Fewer than 50% of pediatric patients with ependymoma undergo complete resection before receiving radiation therapy. Because the extent of resection is one of the most important prognostic factors in the treatment of this disease, increasing the rate of complete resections is a significant means of increasing long-term survival.

Atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western world. Vascular occlusion caused by atherosclerosis usually requires invasive treatment, such as surgical bypass or angioplasty. However, bypass graft failure and restenosis limit the usefulness of these procedures, with 20% of patients needing a new revascularisation procedure within 6 months of angioplasty. Numerous pharmacological agents have been investigated for the prevention of restenosis but none has shown undisputed efficacy in clinical medicine. Gene transfer offers a novel approach to the treatment of restenosis because of easy accessibility of vessels and already existing gene delivery methods. It can be used to overexpress therapeutically important proteins locally without high systemic toxicity, and the therapeutic effect can be targeted to a particular pathophysiological event. Promising results have been obtained from many pre-clinical experiments using therapeutic genes or oligonucleotides to prevent restenosis. Early clinical trials have shown that plasmid- and adenovirus-mediated vascular gene transfers can be conducted safely and are well tolerated. Ex vivo gene therapy with E2F-decoy succeeded in reducing graft occlusion rate after surgical bypass in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial. In the future, further development of gene delivery methods and vectors is needed to improve the efficacy and safety of gene therapy. Also, better knowledge of vascular biology at the molecular level is needed to find optimal strategies and gene combinations to treat restenosis.

One of the major hurdles to successful gene therapy of genetic and/or acquired disease is the ability to efficiently introduce a foreign gene into the tissue of interest and, in the case of some genetic diseases, achieve long-term expression of the transgene. Due to their ability to transduce a wide variety of cell types in a cell-cycle independent fashion, adenovirus (Ad)-based vectors have received considerable attention in recent years as delivery vehicles for multiple gene therapy applications. Effective use of early \"first-generation\" versions of these vectors was hampered by not only the induction of strong immune responses in the host to the Ad vector and transduced cells, but also to direct acute and chronic toxicity caused by the vector itself. Furthermore, transgene expression was typically transient, lasting only a few weeks. Despite these limitations, these vectors have been used in a number of human clinical trials, eliciting both interesting as well as controversial results, some of which are summarized herein. Because of these limitations, a number of advances in adenovirus \"vectorology\", manifested primarily as the development of multiply attenuated Ads and vectors deleted of all viral protein coding sequences, has resulted in vectors which retain all of the advantages of Ad vectors and, in addition, do not exhibit the deleterious characteristics associated with [E1-]deleted Ads.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries. The poor prognosis associated with this disease is closely related to the fact that most lung cancer patients are not identified until their malignancy has reached an advanced stage. Recent advances have added to the understanding of the morphological and molecular characteristics of preinvasive bronchial lesions and early lung cancers. Such information is being used to provide new tests for the detection of lung cancer at early or preinvasive stages, and for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention that can prevent progression to advanced disease. Laser induced fluorescence endoscope bronchoscopy has improved the sensitivity with which preinvasive dysplastic bronchial lesions and early invasive malignancies can be detected. Morphological features of such lesions have been described and can be monitored by follow-up bronchoscopies in order to validate potential chemoprevention treatments. Distinct morphological characteristics such as angiogenic squamous dysplasia also suggest that processes like angiogenesis are present early in the development of lung cancer. Furthermore, tissue obtained from these early lesions has been used to describe alterations in the expression of a number of factors that distinguish these early lesions from normal bronchial epithelium. This could provide molecular markers and targets for the detection and treatment of early lung cancer. Studies to detect these alterations by polymerase chain reaction and/or immunhistochemical analyses of easily obtained specimens such as sputa are helping identifing molecular markers that could be utilized in effective screening programmes.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is associated with heat and water loss from the airways. It is not known whether these conditions can influence the response to bronchoactive agonists. The effects of different degrees of alveolar ventilation on the pulmonary response to methacholine and the role of humidity and temperature in this response were evaluated. Wistar rats were anaesthetized, tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated. Increasing doses of methacholine were infused intravenously and respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) were measured. The rats were ventilated with dry air at 13 degrees C, dry air at 37 degrees C, humid air at 13 degrees C and humid air at 37 degrees C. These four groups were further divided into three subgroups with a respiratory frequency adjusted to reach a carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood of 30, 40 and 50 mmHg. Temperature, humidity and level of alveolar ventilation did not influence the position of the dose/response curve to methacholine. However, the maximal changes in Ers were significantly lower in the rats ventilated with humid air. In addition, maximal changes in Ers were significantly higher in the rats with lower alveolar ventilation. These differences were not observed for maximal values of Rrs.

Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed a standard or a Zn-deficient diet for 4 weeks, we examined whether Zn deficiency affects systemic blood pressure (BP) levels in a genetically hypertensive state through a fall in the activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet had a progressive increase in systolic BP during the dietary conditioning. Consequently, SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet exhibited significantly increased levels of systolic BP by 2 weeks after the start of dietary treatment when compared with SHR fed a standard diet. Similarly, levels of basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) observed at the end of dietary treatment were SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet &gt; SHR fed a standard diet. Administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME, caused an increase in MAP levels in the two groups of rats, demonstrating the involvement of the vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), in the regulation of systemic BP in a genetically hypertensive state. The expression of endothelial (e) NOS mRNA and protein in the thoracic aorta paralleled basal MAP levels in the two groups of rats, suggesting the counter-regulation of eNOS against the developed hypertensive state in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet. On the other hand, administration of the superoxide scavenger, tempol (a SOD mimetic compound), led to a decrease in MAP levels in the two groups of rats, indicating the participation of the oxygen free radical, superoxide, in an increase in systemic BP in a genetically hypertensive state. As reported recently, the mechanism involved is due likely to a decrease in the action of the vasodilator, NO, based on the formation of peroxynitrite coming from the non-enzymatic reaction of superoxide and NO. In addition, tempol treatment completely restored MAP levels in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet to levels comparable to those observed in SHR fed a standard diet, indicating that a further increase in systemic BP levels seen in SHR fed a Zn-deficient vs. a standard diet is presumably brought by a reduction in the action of the vasodilator, NO, resulting from an increase in the action of superoxide. The activity of the superoxide scavenger, Cu/Zn-SOD, in the thoracic aorta was significantly decreased in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet relative to SHR fed a standard diet. It appears that a decrease in the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD observed in the thoracic aorta of SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet at least in part plays a role in an increase in the action of superoxide in this model. Thus, Zn deficiency may be a factor to develop genetic hypertension presumably through the oxidative stress caused by superoxide.", "answer": "Decreased activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase due to zinc deficiency exacerbates hypertension.", "covered": false}

Profiles and depth dose distributions resulting from the simulation show good agreement with the measurements. Deviations of less than 2% can be observed.

Abundant evidence indicates that 11betaHSD2 is expressed as mRNA and protein in both adrenal cortex and adrenal tumors. In contrast, 11betaHSD1 has been investigated to a much lesser degree. We therefore studied and compared the expression and activity of the two isoenzymes in the human adrenal cortex (HAC) and cortisol-secreting adenomas (CSAs). Six HAC and six CSA specimens were studied. 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 gene expression was studied by conventional and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity was assayed by measuring the capacity of both microsomal fraction and tissue fragments to convert [3H]cortisone to [3H]cortisol and vice versa. Steroid hormones were separated and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and cortisol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic assay demonstrated higher 11betaHSD1 expression and activity and lower 11betaHSD2 expression and activity in CSAs than in HACs. CSA slices secreted larger amounts of cortisol than did HAC specimens, and the cholesterol side-chain-cleaving enzyme inhibitor aminoglutethimide, by blocking the early step of steroid synthesis, reduced cortisol secretion by approximately 70%. Aminoglutethimide decreased [3H]cortisol production from [3H]cortisone and increased [3H]cortisone production from [3H]cortisol in both tissues, thereby annulling differences in 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity between HACs and CSAs. Collectively, our findings indicate that 1) both 11betaHSD isoenzymes are expressed as mRNA and proteins in the HAC and CSA, with 11betaHSD1 upregulated and 1betaHSD2 downregulated in CSAs; and 2) 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity is positively and negatively correlated with the intracellular concentration of steroid hormones.

Planning the incision should start distally at the fingertips where planning for the paronychial fold begins. The typical technique for the development of these folds involves laterally based triangular flaps that, once released, will be sutured into the respective digit creating a new nail fold. [12] Next, the dorsal and palmar incisions are drawn proximally in a zig-zag fashion to create the previously described triangular flaps. It is important to ensure the flaps are drawn in such a way that the dorsal and volar flaps will not interdigitate with each other. [8] As the incision is planned distally, the planned height of the webspace is determined. Once determined, a dorsal rectangular flap is typically drawn with a volar triangular based flap. Once the incisions are drawn, the case starts distally, starting with the paronychial folds and progresses about the dorsal incision. It is important to create full-thickness flaps as you proceed with your dissection. Careful dissection is carried out to identify the neurovascular bundles. Typically, these bifurcate proximally, but cases have been noted with a more distal bifurcation. If a distal bifurcation is noted, it is important to carefully dissect each neurovascular bundle so they can be incorporated into the correct digit.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_527_2", "question": "What are some cellular barriers that impede the nuclear translocation of non-viral gene vectors in comparison to viral vectors?", "doc_chunk": "Intracellular barriers to non-viral gene transfer. Non-viral vector mediated gene transfer, compared to viral vector mediated one, is a promising tool for the safe delivery of therapeutic DNA in genetic and acquired human diseases. Although the lack of specific immune response favor the clinical application of non-viral vectors, comprising of an expression cassette complexed to cationic liposome or cationic polymer, the limited efficacy and short duration of transgene expression impose major hurdles in the widespread application of non-viral gene therapy. The trafficking of transgene, complexed with chemical vectors, has been the subject of intensive investigations to improve our understanding of cellular and extracellular barriers impeding gene delivery. Here, we review those physical and metabolic impediments that account, at least in part, for the inefficient translocation of transgene into the nucleus of target cells. Following the internalization of the DNA-polycation complex by endocytosis, a large fraction is targeted to the lysosomal compartment by default. Since the cytosolic release of heterelogous DNA is a prerequisite for nuclear translocation, entrapment and degradation of plasmid DNA in endo-lysosomes constitute a major impediment to efficient gene transfer. Only a small fraction of internalized plasmid DNA penetrates the cytoplasm. Plasmid DNA encounters the diffusional and metabolic barriers of the cytoplasm, further decreasing the number of intact plasmid molecules reaching the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the gateway of nucleosol. Nuclear translocation of DNA requires either the disassembly of the nuclear envelope or active nuclear transport via the NPC. Comparison of viral and plasmid DNA cellular trafficking should reveal strategies that viruses have developed to overcome those cellular barriers that impede non-viral DNA delivery in gene therapy attempts.", "answer": "Entrapment and degradation in endo-lysosomes.", "covered": false}

The calcaneocuboid joint is a synovial joint between: the facet on the anterior surface of the calcaneus, and the corresponding facet on the posterior surface of the cuboid. The calcaneocuboid joint allows sliding and rotating movements involved with inversion and eversion of the foot, and also contributes to pronation and supination of the forefoot on the hindfoot.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_793_1", "question": "What is the relationship between 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 gene expression and activity in cortisol-secreting adenomas and human adrenal cortex?", "doc_chunk": "11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase types 1 and 2 are up- and downregulated in cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas. 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase types 1 and 2 (11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2) are two isoenzymes that convert inactive glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisone) to their active forms (e.g., cortisol) and vice versa. Abundant evidence indicates that 11betaHSD2 is expressed as mRNA and protein in both adrenal cortex and adrenal tumors. In contrast, 11betaHSD1 has been investigated to a much lesser degree. We therefore studied and compared the expression and activity of the two isoenzymes in the human adrenal cortex (HAC) and cortisol-secreting adenomas (CSAs). Six HAC and six CSA specimens were studied. 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 gene expression was studied by conventional and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity was assayed by measuring the capacity of both microsomal fraction and tissue fragments to convert [3H]cortisone to [3H]cortisol and vice versa. Steroid hormones were separated and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and cortisol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic assay demonstrated higher 11betaHSD1 expression and activity and lower 11betaHSD2 expression and activity in CSAs than in HACs. CSA slices secreted larger amounts of cortisol than did HAC specimens, and the cholesterol side-chain-cleaving enzyme inhibitor aminoglutethimide, by blocking the early step of steroid synthesis, reduced cortisol secretion by approximately 70%. Aminoglutethimide decreased [3H]cortisol production from [3H]cortisone and increased [3H]cortisone production from [3H]cortisol in both tissues, thereby annulling differences in 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity between HACs and CSAs. Collectively, our findings indicate that 1) both 11betaHSD isoenzymes are expressed as mRNA and proteins in the HAC and CSA, with 11betaHSD1 upregulated and 1betaHSD2 downregulated in CSAs; and 2) 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity is positively and negatively correlated with the intracellular concentration of steroid hormones. Hence, 11betaHSD isoenzymes could act as amplifiers of the secretagogue effect of agonists and could contribute to the elevated hormonal secretion of CSAs.", "answer": "In cortisol-secreting adenomas (CSAs), there is higher expression and activity of 11betaHSD1 and lower expression and activity of 11betaHSD2 compared to the human adrenal cortex (HAC).", "covered": false}

The authors report 6 self-paced word-by-word reading studies of how morphosyntactic agreement, focus status, and the structural constraints of binding theory apply and interact during the online interpretation of pronouns (e.g., him, her) and anaphors (e.g., himself, each other). Previous studies held that structural conditions on coreference work as interpretive filters that impose exceptionless limits on which antecedent candidates can be evaluated by subsequent, content-based processes. These experiments instead support an interactive-parallel-constraint model, in which multiple weighted constraints (including constraints on binding) simultaneously influence the net activation of a candidate during preselection stages of antecedent evaluation. Accordingly, structurally inaccessible candidates can interfere with antecedent selection if they are both prominent in focus structure and gender-number compatible with the pronoun or anaphor.", "answer": "The interactive-parallel-constraint model posits that multiple weighted constraints, including structural constraints from binding theory, simultaneously influence the activation of antecedent candidates during their preselection, allowing even structurally inaccessible candidates to impact the selection process if they meet certain focus and compatibility conditions.", "covered": false}

There is a growing literature on childhood-onset AN, and it seems that the core behavioral, psychologic, and physical features are similar to those in adults. The differences between children and adults also must be taken into account, however. Because children have lower levels of body fat, they tend to become emaciated and suffer the effects of starvation for more quickly than adults, which must be taken into account when considering treatment. Although cases of childhood-onset BN have been reported, they are so rare that empirical research is difficult. Clinical features reported regarding the atypical childhood-onset eating disorders generally concur, although empirical testing of these features has yet to be developed. Theories as to why children develop these disorders need further development. The general consensus is that all childhood-onset eating disorders must be considered using a multidimensional model that takes into account physical, psychologic, social, and family factors in origin, assessment, and treatment.", "answer": "Physical, psychological, social, and family factors.", "covered": false}

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_1098_1", "question": "How does bupropion SR affect smoking cessation rates compared to a placebo?", "doc_chunk": "Clinical efficacy of bupropion in the management of smoking cessation. Nicotine addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that can be difficult to treat. Until recently, pharmacological options for the treatment of tobacco dependence were primarily limited to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) is the first non-nicotine pharmacological treatment approved for smoking cessation. Bupropion SR is recommended for first-line pharmacotherapy alongside NRT in the updated US Clinical Practice Guidelines and the UK Health Education Authority Guidelines. The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommends NRT and bupropion SR for smokers who have expressed a desire to quit smoking. This review presents evidence that bupropion SR is an effective first-line therapy for smoking cessation in a wide range of patient populations. It is associated with significantly higher smoking cessation rates compared with placebo in patients with or without a history of prior bupropion SR or NRT use, and its effect is independent of gender. Bupropion SR treatment is effective in the prevention of relapse to smoking in those patients who have successfully quit, and re-treatment is effective in smokers who recommence smoking after a previous course of bupropion SR. Bupropion SR treatment relieves the symptoms of craving and nicotine withdrawal, and attenuates the weight gain that often occurs after smoking cessation. Data collected from motivational support programmes and employer-based studies provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of bupropion SR as an aid to smoking cessation in 'real life' situations, and confirm the efficacy seen in clinical trials.", "answer": "Significantly higher.", "covered": false}

Sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) was first launched in the US in 1997 as an aid to smoking cessation and has since been launched in many other countries. Adverse events associated with the use of bupropion SR at the recommended dosage of 150mg twice daily in clinical trials most commonly included insomnia, headache, dry mouth, nausea and anxiety; insomnia and anxiety are also recognised as symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Only insomnia and dry mouth occurred significantly more frequently with bupropion SR than with placebo. Relative to placebo, no significant changes in mean values for heart rate, blood pressure or routine laboratory parameters have been reported in smokers using bupropion SR alone in clinical trials. When bupropion SR was compared with a nicotine transdermal patch in a clinical trial, insomnia predominated in the bupropion SR group, while dream abnormalities were more common in smokers using the nicotine patch. Bupropion SR and the nicotine transdermal patch in combination can be used safely (with appropriate monitoring) as an aid to smoking cessation. Infrequent but clinically important adverse reactions to bupropion SR include seizures and hypersensitivity reactions: in controlled clinical trials of bupropion SR (300 mg/day), where smokers were carefully screened for risk factors for seizure, the incidence of both seizures and severe hypersensitivity reactions was approximately 0.1% for each event. In order to avoid a risk of seizure of greater than 0.1%, smokers should be screened for predisposing risk factors and adhere to the manufacturer's dosage recommendations (maximum daily dose of 300mg). Thus, bupropion SR is generally well tolerated, as seen by the low discontinuation rate due to an adverse event in clinical trials (6 to 12%). The most common adverse events (insomnia and dry mouth) are generally transient and often resolve quickly without therapeutic intervention; they can be managed if necessary by a reduction in bupropion dose.", "answer": "300 mg", "covered": false}

Health resource use is better measured in financial rather than volume amounts, to account for service intensity. However, financial measures reported in claims records need to be carefully chosen. Between-group comparisons are frequently affected by selection bias, and within-group comparisons are often limited by period bias. While selection bias can be addressed by controlling for patient factors such as disease severity, and period bias by controlling for trend, devising appropriate control measures from the limited information in claims data can be challenging.

Event-based prospective memory requires responding to cues in the environment that are associated with a previously established intention. Some researchers believe that intentions reside in memory with an above baseline level of activation, a phenomenon called the intention superiority effect. The authors of this study predicted that intention superiority would be masked by additional cognitive processes associated with successful event-based prospective memory. These additional processes include noticing the cue, retrieving the intention, and coordinating intention execution with the ongoing activity. In 3 experiments, intention superiority was demonstrated by faster latencies to the ongoing activity on failed prospective trials and the existence of the additional processes was demonstrated by slower latencies on successful trials. This study demonstrates the importance of investigating the microstructure of the cognitive components involved with processing and responding to an event-based prospective memory cue.", "answer": "The intention superiority effect is defined as intentions residing in memory with an above baseline level of activation.", "covered": false}

This study sought to evaluate the long-term prognostic significance of stress-redistribution-reinjection Tl-201 imaging in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and coronary artery bypass surgery. Preoperative stress-redistribution-reinjection Tl-201 imaging detects viable but asynergic segments which show functional improvement postoperatively and is considered as a valuable noninvasive method in selection of patients with severe LV dysfunction for revascularization. The long-term prognostic value of the reinjection technique remains unclear. Fifty-two patients with severe LV dysfunction (mean ejection fraction (EF) 0.32+/-0.03) who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in 1993-1994 were included in the study. Patients had follow-up 49+/-12 months. LV function was assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Perfusion was assessed by Tl-201 SPECT imaging and was graded on a four-point scale (0 = normal, 3 = absent uptake) using the 20 segment model. Perfusion index was derived by adding the score of all segments and dividing these by 20. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised patients with seven and more dysfunctional viable myocardial segments. Group B included patients with less than seven dysfunctional but viable segments. Mean EF increased from 0.32+/-0.03 to 0.46+/-0.04. Mean perfusion index did not show a significant difference as a whole during follow-up compared to the early postoperative values (0.9+/-0.4 and 1.1+/-0.4, p = NS). When adequacy of revascularization was considered, the predictive value of a positive preoperative viability test for functional improvement was 82%. Nineteen cardiac events occurred in group B patients and six in group A patients: six deaths (four from cardiac and two from noncardiac causes), 13 myocardial infarctions (MI). Multivariate Cox survival analysis identified the number of viable segments detected preoperatively (chi2 = 7.2, p = 0.002), postoperative improvement in Tl-uptake (chi2 = 6.6, p = 0.01) and functional improvement (chi2 = 5.3, p = 0.03) postoperatively as independent predictors of cardiac events.

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been shown to be a means of reducing the need for endotracheal intubation, which when effective reduces the complication rate and improves outcome. Because paralysis and sedation are not needed and because the patient is not necessarily dependent upon a machine for respiration, ventilation outside the intensive care unit (ICU) is an option. A number of studies have shown that NPPV for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be effective in the non-ICU environment, though usually in patients with less severe exacerbations. However, there have been no direct comparisons of the application of NPPV in different locations. The likelihood of success of the technique is an important factor in deciding there NPPV should be performed. Ready access to invasive ventilation is important when NPPV is not indicated from the outset or fails after an initial trial. In acute exacerbations of COPD, NPPV is less likely to be successful the more severe the exacerbation, as measured by the severity of acidosis. Good tolerance of NPPV, which translates into an improvement in pH and a fall in respiratory rate, predicts a successful outcome and is a useful way of monitoring progress. NPPV has been shown to be cost effective both in the ICU and when performed on general wards. A dedicated intermediate care unit with particular expertise in noninvasive modes of ventilation may provide the best environment, both in terms of outcome, but also cost effectiveness. The ideal location for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation will vary from country to country and indeed from hospital to hospital, depending upon local factors.

Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus capable of causing severe respiratory illness in immunocompromised individuals, resides in macrophages during mammalian infection. Previous studies suggest that siderophore-mediated iron transport may be important for the acquisition of iron from transferrin while the organism resides in macrophages. However, iron is also present as hemin in the intracellular environment of the macrophage and may serve as a major source of iron during infection. Thus the ability of H. capsulatum to use hemin and heme-containing compounds was examined. Histoplasma capsulatum G217B was iron-starved by adding the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate to the culture. The addition of 10 microM hemin in the presence of deferoxamine mesylate restored growth to the levels seen in the absence of the chelator. Histoplasma capsulatum was also cultivated in an iron-limited, chemically defined medium without the addition of chelators and it was determined that the organism could also use hemoglobin as a sole source of iron. The method of iron internalization from heme was examined by measuring hemin binding to the yeast-cell surface. The ability of H. capsulatum to bind hemin was related to the nutritional status of the cells. Cells grown under iron-limited conditions bound more heme to the cell surface than did cells grown in medium without chelator. Pretreatment of iron-starved cells with proteinase K eliminated the ability of the organism to bind hemin. Additionally, the pre-incubation of iron-starved H. capsulatum with hemin eliminated the ability of these cells to remove hemin from the solution, although pre-incubation of cells with the iron-free form of hemin, protoporphyrin IX, only modestly affected the ability of the organism to bind hemin. These results suggest that H. capsulatum uses hemin as a sole source of iron and that one mechanism of iron acquisition involves a cell-surface receptor for hemin.", "answer": "Proteinase K treatment eliminates the ability of iron-starved H. capsulatum cells to bind hemin.", "covered": false}

Ischemic coronary syndrome is still the most frequent cause of mortality in the United States. Despite extensive investigation into the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI), this process remains quite complex because the majority of patients with chest pain have atypical symptoms and nonspecific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and fall in the low or medium risk category. The biochemical cardiac markers play an important role in helping physicians make the diagnosis of acute MI and stratify patients for risk modifications. The use of cardiac markers in the diagnosis of acute MI is discussed extensively on pages 36-44 of this issue. This article focuses on reviewing other clinical applications. This field is large and rapidly expanding, making it impossible to cover every single clinical application of cardiac markers. Several research efforts are underway to find better cardiac markers and develop new applications for them.

Increased A(254 nm)/A(410 nm) ratios in the epilimnion during summer and early autumn suggested degradation of higher molecular size organic matter into low molecular size NOM. Increase in ammonium and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in the lake was possibly due to the NOM degradation. Using budget calculations and the literature values, photodegradation and microbial activity were estimated to be the main mechanisms of the NOM removal. These mechanisms accounted for about 30-35% and 60-65% of the total loss of organic matter, respectively, in the summer and early autumn period.

A laboratory-scale microbubble dispersion (MBD) generator was shown to improve oxygen transfer to aerobic microorganisms when coupled to the conventional air-sparger. However, the process was not demonstrated on a large scale to prove its practical application. We investigated the scale-up of a spinning-disk MBD generator for the aerobic fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). A 1-L spinning-disk MBD generator was used to supply air for 1- and 50-L working volume fermentation of baker's yeast. For the two levels investigated, the MBD generator maintained an adequate supply of surfactant-stabilized air microbubbles to the microorganisms at a relatively low agitation rate (150 rpm). There was a significant improvement in oxygen transfer to the microorganism relative to the conventional sparger. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa, for the MBD system at 150 rpm was 765 h(-1) compared to 937 h(-1) for the conventional sparger at 500 rpm. It is plausible to surmise that fermentation using larger working volumes may further improve the kLa values and the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels because of longer hold-up times and, consequently, improve cell growth. There was no statistically significant difference between the cell mass yield on substrate (0.43 g/g) under the MBD regime at an agitation rate of 150 rpm and that achieved for the conventional air-sparged system (0.53 g/g) at an agitation rate of 500 rpm.

The TSMSBM includes six features that are essential for describing multiple-species biofilms that undergo changes over time: (1) four biomass types: heterotrophs, ammonia oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers, and inert biomass; (2) seven chemical species: input biodegradable organic material (BOM), NH4(+)-N, NO2(-)-N, NO3(-)-N, utilization-associated products, biomass-associated products, and dissolved oxygen; (3) eight reactions that describe the rates of consumption or production of the different species, as well as the stoichiometric linkages among the rates; (4) reaction with diffusion of all the soluble species in the biofilm; (5) growth, decay, detachment, and flux of each biomass type by location in the biofilm; and (6) constant or periodic detachment of biofilm, both of which allow for protection of biomass deep inside the biofilm.

The objectives of the Forbeck Foundation are to promote advances and shorten the research timetable in the field of oncology, particularly pediatric oncology. The Foundation's centerpiece activity is an annual scientific forum held at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where 12 to 15 leading scientists from a variety of disciplines associated with a specific topic are invited to participate in a private \"think tank\" environment, where they can freely exchange ideas in the hope of building on each other's knowledge and experience. Additionally, the Foundation sponsors grants for Focus Meetings, which are designed to give other researchers an opportunity to conduct their own meetings along the lines of the Foundation's annual forum. The idea for this Focus Meeting was born during the 2000 Annual Forbeck Forum in South Carolina, which considered the current status of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Participants considered various obstacles to conducting clinical trials in this area and decided to bring together experts from academia, industry, and government to discuss ways in which these obstacles might be overcome. Topics included efficient clinical trial designs, issues of monitoring and reporting adverse events, and appropriate definitions and grading systems for transplantation-specific outcomes.

Our objective was to validate the eczema component of the self-applicable ISAAC's WQ following its translation into Portuguese. The group of 10 pediatricians and 10 pediatric allergologists graded the questions from 0 to 2 and established the maximum score for each question. The WQ was answered by parents or guardians of children with atopic dermatitis (AE), aged 6-7 years (n = 23) and of non-AE control children of the same age (n = 46) as well as by AE (n = 24) and non-AE (n = 48) adolescents, aged 13-14 years.

An earlier conceptual model recognized explicitly that human activities, especially agriculture, have both depleted terrestrial N and increased the fixation of atmospheric N in biologically available forms. The current conceptual model does not include adequate treatment of the depletion of the terrestrial N reservoir, the resulting transfer of N to the hydrosphere and atmosphere, or the cycling of terrestrial N below the plow layer.

From veterinary point of view Malassezia pachydermatis has the greatest significance. It has been standing in the focus of interest since the early 1990s, mostly because of the frequency of otitis externa and dermatitis caused by this yeast in dogs. This is the only lipid-independent species in the genus Malassezia. It can be found in very large proportion on the skin of healthy animals, but can be isolated in much greater number from diseased dogs. It often causes illness together with other pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus intermedius). Some breeds are predisposed. In addition to the treatment of the accidental concurrent diseases, therapy consists of systemic and/or topical antimicrobial treatment. Ketoconazole is used most frequently. Malassezia pachydermatis plays also a role in the skin disorders of other carnivores. It has little zoonotic potential, it can be dangerous to immunocompromised humans. The other Malassezia species have little veterinary importance, although M. sympodialis and M. globosa were isolated from asymptomatic animals (mostly cats) and from mixed infections.", "answer": "Malassezia pachydermatis is significant in veterinary medicine due to its role in causing frequent otitis externa and dermatitis in dogs, its unique lipid-independence, and its presence in higher numbers on diseased animals.", "covered": false}

Significant progress has been made recently in the development of gene therapy for hemophilia. This has been primarily due to the technical improvements of existing vector systems and the development of new gene delivery methods. Therapeutic and sometimes physiologic levels of FVIII and FIX could be achieved in FVIII- and FIX-deficient mice and hemophilic dogs using different types of viral vectors. In these preclinical studies, long-term correction of the bleeding disorders and in some cases a permanent cure has been realized. However, complications related to the induction of neutralizing antibodies or viral promoter inactivation often precludes stable phenotypic correction. Several gene therapy phase I clinical trials have been initiated in patients suffering from severe hemophilia A or B.

In this work, etanidazole (one type of hypoxic radiosensitizer) is encapsulated into spray dried poly(D),L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres and then compressed into discs for controlled release applications. Etanidazole is characterized by intracellular glutathione depletion and glutathione transferases inhibition, thereby enhancing sensitivity to radiation. It is also cytotoxic to tumor cells and can chemosensitize some alkylating agents by activating their tumor cell killing capabilities. We observed the release characteristics of etanidazole in the dosage forms of microspheres and discs, subjected to different preparation conditions. The release characteristics, morphology changes, particle size, and encapsulation efficiency of microspheres are also investigated. The release rate of etanidazole from implantable discs (13 mm in diameter, 1 mm in thickness, fabricated by a press) is much lower than microspheres due to the reduced specific surface. After the initial burst of 1% release for the first day, the cumulative release within the first week is less than 2% until a secondary burst of release (caused by polymer degradation) occurs after one month. Some key preparation conditions such as drug loadings, disc thickness and diameter, and compression pressure can affect the initial burst of etanidazole from the discs. However, none of them can significantly make the release more uniform. In contrast, the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) can greatly enhance the release rate of discs and also reduces the secondary burst effect, thereby achieving a sustained release for about 2 months.", "answer": "Etanidazole is encapsulated into spray dried PLGA microspheres which are then compressed into discs.", "covered": false}

Although Bonaparte brought about many sound political and national improvements, when France had been brought to its knees by the bloody Revolution, his ambitions became excessive and his military forays difficult to support. Following early successes in the field, he underestimated the determination, persistence and the ability of some opposing commanders. The French medical services profited greatly from the innovations of the post-revolutionary period, and the efforts of men such as Larrey and Percy. The British Army medical support was scanty, and, initially lacked experience. To some extent, this latter defect was corrected by Sir James McGrigor during the Peninsular War.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on static pulmonary compliance and sputum clearance in stable intubated and ventilated patients. Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied. This was a double crossover study where all patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences over two days. The first sequence involved manual hyperinflation followed two hours later by ventilator hyperinflation and the order was reversed on the second day. In the second sequence, ventilator hyperinflation preceded manual hyperinflation. The variables of static pulmonary compliance and sputum wet weight were analysed by use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. There was no significant difference in sputum wet weight production between either technique or on either day of treatment.

Gene transfer into hematopoietic cells is currently being used to modulate immune responses, to protect hematopoietic cells against cytotoxic drugs or viral genes, and to restore gene deficiencies due to either inborn genetic defects or acquired loss of regular gene function. In particular, gene addition strategies for inherited severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency or defects of the interleukin-2 receptor gamma-chain represent potentially curative strategies based on gene transfer into hematopoietic cells using recombinant retroviral vectors. Since long-term correction of genetic defects in hematopoietic cells often requires transduction of hematopoietic stem cells, an effective gene transfer into stem cells with efficient long-term and multi-lineage transgene expression is the desired goal for these therapeutic strategies. However, gene transfer strategies with retroviral vectors unable to integrate into non-cycling cells are limited by the quiescent state of the stem cells that have to be stimulated by cytokines to induce cell cycle progression. To circumvent these barriers, lentiviral vector systems based on HIV-1 have recently been developed which are able to deliver and express genes in non-dividing cells both in vitro and in vivo. This review outlines the development and improvement of lentivirus-based gene transfer protocols and discusses the use of lentiviral vectors in preclinical gene therapy studies.", "answer": "Modulating immune responses, protecting against cytotoxic drugs or viral genes, and restoring gene deficiencies in conditions like SCID.", "covered": false}

The cloned vanilloid (capsaicin) receptor subtype 1 (VR1) integrates multiple noxious stimuli on peripheral terminals of primary sensory neurons. The initial excitation of these neurons is followed by a lasting refractory state, traditionally termed desensitization, that has clear therapeutic potential. Capsaicin is used to relieve neuropathic pain, uremic pruritus, and bladder overactivity. The ultrapotent vanilloid resiniferatoxin, now in phase 2 clinical trials, has improved tolerability. A less recognized human exposure to high capsaicin concentrations may occur by pepper sprays used in law enforcement. Evidence is mounting that VR1 expression is not restricted to sensory neurons. From the olfactory bulb to the cerebellum, VR1-expressing neurons are present in a number of brain nuclei, where they might be activated by anandamide. VR1 presence also was demonstrated in nonneuronal tissues. These discoveries place VR1 in a much broader perspective than pain perception and enhance the potential for unforeseen side effects, especially following prolonged vanilloid therapy. The expression of VR1 is plastic and down-regulated during vanilloid therapy, which might have a pivotal role in desensitization.

The aim of the present study was to search for a sensorimotor marker (i.e., visuopostural tuning) that could be correlated with the severity of motor impairments in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Given that autistic children were previously reported to be posturally hyporeactive to visually perceived environmental motion in comparison with normal control children (Gepner et al., 1995), we sought to determine whether children with Asperger syndrome (AS) would share the same postural hyporeactivity to visual motion. Three autistic children with mild to severe motor impairments, three AS children with soft motor signs, and nine normal control children were tested for overall postural instability and postural reactivity to environmental motion. Results indicate, first, that overall postural instability is significantly reduced in autistic children compared with both AS and normal children. Second, although postural oscillations in the fore-aft axis become more attuned to the oscillation frequency of an immersive dynamic visual display as visual speed is increased, in both control and AS subjects, this is not the case in autistic children. Despite the small number of subjects tested in this study, our data confirm the existence of a visuopostural detuning in autistic children. Third, they argue for a correlation between visuopostural tuning and severity of motor signs in children with autistic spectrum disorders.

Current applications and future promise. Docetaxel (Taxotere)-based regimens can be included among the most effective treatment options for the management of patients with advanced, androgen-independent prostate cancer. Results with docetaxel as a single agent and in combination regimens with estramustine (Emcyt) have consistently achieved a palliative response, reduced serum PSA levels by &gt; or = 50%, and produced objective responses in patients with measurable disease. In addition, encouraging survival data have been demonstrated in several phase II trials. The ability to administer docetaxel on a weekly basis has substantially enhanced research efforts for treatment in prostate cancer patients. The results of ongoing phase III randomized trials evaluating docetaxel regimens in androgen-independent prostate cancer are eagerly awaited for their potential to definitively demonstrate a beneficial impact on overall patient survival. Docetaxel-containing regimens are likely to demonstrate a substantial role in the management of early-stage prostate cancer patients in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, where clinical investigations are under way. In addition, study results from ongoing trials that integrate docetaxel with hormonal therapies for patients with biochemical recurrence following definitive local treatments will be important in refining the future role of chemotherapy for prostate cancer in general. The preliminary findings from studies conducted with docetaxel are encouraging and await final analysis. Finally, preliminary results from studies exploring combination regimens of docetaxel and novel agents that possess completely different mechanisms of action (eg, proapoptotic agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, and vitamin D analogs) have demonstrated the regimens to be feasible and safe, with promising early response data.

Beta-lactamases are the most widespread resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics and are an increasing menace to public health. Several beta-lactamase structures have been determined, making this enzyme an attractive target for structure-based drug design. To facilitate inhibitor design for the class C beta-lactamase AmpC, binding site \"hot spots\" on the enzyme were identified using experimental and computational approaches. Experimentally, X-ray crystal structures of AmpC in complexes with four boronic acid inhibitors and a higher resolution (1.72 A) native apo structure were determined. Along with previously determined structures of AmpC in complexes with five other boronic acid inhibitors and four beta-lactams, consensus binding sites were identified. Computationally, the programs GRID, MCSS, and X-SITE were used to predict potential binding site hot spots on AmpC. Several consensus binding sites were identified from the crystal structures. An amide recognition site was identified by the interaction between the carbonyl oxygen in the R1 side chain of beta-lactams and the atom Ndelta2 of the conserved Asn152. Surprisingly, this site also recognizes the aryl rings of arylboronic acids, appearing to form quadrupole-dipole interactions with Asn152. The highly conserved \"oxyanion\" hole defines a site that recognizes both carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. A hydroxyl binding site was identified by the O2 hydroxyl in the boronic acids, which hydrogen bonds with Tyr150 and a conserved water. A hydrophobic site is formed by Leu119 and Leu293. A carboxylate binding site was identified by the ubiquitous C3(4) carboxylate of the beta-lactams, which interacts with Asn346 and Arg349. Four water sites were identified by ordered waters observed in most of the structures; these waters form extensive hydrogen-bonding networks with AmpC and occasionally the ligand. Predictions by the computational programs showed some correlation with the experimentally observed binding sites. Several sites were not predicted, but novel binding sites were suggested. Taken together, a map of binding site hot spots found on AmpC, along with information on the functionality recognized at each site, was constructed. This map may be useful for structure-based inhibitor design against AmpC.", "answer": "The amide recognition site on AmpC was identified by the interaction between the carbonyl oxygen in the R1 side chain of beta-lactams and the atom Ndelta2 of the conserved Asn152.", "covered": false}

To measure, in a real-life setting, the benefits of using ready-to-use (RTU) injection preparations compared with conventional reconstituted admixtures (Admix) in terms of cost savings. DESIGN AND PERSPECTIVE: An economic model was developed, based on a randomised study. The perspective of the economic evaluation was that of the hospital administration. A microcosting approach was used to determine costs. Department of Cardiac Surgery at the Charleroi University Hospital in Belgium. Fifty-eight patients undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass were randomised to Admix dobutamine or to the RTU dobutamine group and were followed up during 24 hours after initiation of dobutamine therapy. Nursing time was reduced by 32% in the RTU group compared with the Admix group.

Ever since the first decades of the 20th century, some authors have given respiratory infection triggered by bacteria an etiologic role in bronchial asthma, focusing on infection and the asthmatic response. In 1995 our group already presented a study in this sense on nasal secretion cultures and the relationship between IgE and sensitization to allergens. There is a significant association between patients with sensitization to Dermatophagoides, high levels of total IgE, and positive culture to Staphylococcus aureus. Following studies by Norn, we performed a study with 40 children, aged 2-14 years, where we observed that children with sensitization to mites and a positive culture had higher levels of histamine release than did children with negative culture and controls, the differences being significant. We also found, like other authors, that the joint presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Derrmatophagoides pteronyssinus potentiates antigen-specific histamine release. In recent years, with the increasing prevalence of bronchial asthma being studied, the role that infection could play in this increase is being considered again among other factors. As participants of the ISAAC project and using the same methods as in this study, we performed a simultaneous questionnaire with questions related with triggering and contributing factors, etc., including respiratory infection. We found an association between having had more than three episodes of \"bronchitis\" with fever and lasting for longer than seven days in the last year and having ever had asthma (OR 29.09). This association is still greater with having had wheezing in the last 12 months (OR 43.26), a finding that it is also associated with requiring attention in an emergency room (OR 30.65). From these results, we concluded that respiratory infection is an aggravating factor of asthma, something we already knew. In order to have our own experience, we studied serum interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) in a sample of 41 children aged 3 to 17 years. The most frequent values of IL-4 ranged between 0.25 and 0.40 ng, and very low dispersion was found in the sample, which did not allow correlation with other parameters. Regarding IFNgamma, we found values between &lt; 5 pg/ml and 605 pg/ml. When we studied children under treatment with antigen-specific immunotherapy, we observed mean values of IFNgamma of 115.86 pg/ml, whereas the ones who did not follow this treatment or had followed it for less than one year had a mean of 66.06 pg/ml, these differences being significant (p = 0.035), and proving a Th1 response to immunotherapy. This significance is not found if children who have been under immunotherapy for less than one year are included. When we studied children with bacterial immunotherapy, we found that the mean IFNgamma value in children under immunotherapy for longer than one year was 56.4 pg/ml, whereas in children with no immunotherapy it was 101.75 pg/ml (p = 0.034).

The association between the risk of breast cancer and the physical load of work was studied because physical activity may reduce breast cancer risk via hormonal mechanisms. Occupational physical activity was estimated from a self-determined rating [scale 1 (low)-5 (high)] of occupational physical load for 1800 randomly selected women born in 1930-1969. The medians of the ratings were used as occupation-specific indices of occupational physical activity. All 65 occupations with at least 5 ratings, covering 75% of the economically active female population in Finland, were included in further analyses. The occupation-specific numbers of observed and expected cases of breast cancer during 1971-1995 among women born in 1906-1945 (17,986 cases) were grouped according to the index for occupational physical activity. Expected rates were calculated with the social-class-specific population and the entire Finnish female population as reference populations. The relative risks (RR) of breast cancer for categories 3-5, in comparison with categories 1-2 were calculated using Poisson regression models. The occupation-specific mean number of children and mean age at first childbirth were adjusted for. The RR was lower for occupations in category 5 than for those in categories 1-4, especially in the youngest (25-39 years) age group (RR 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.58). Adjustment for social class and reproductive factors raised the RR (95% confidence interval 0.56-0.74) for category 5 in different age strata, all the RR values still being statistically significant.

Twenty-five dyspeptic patients (6 men, 19 women) with a mean age of 64.8 years (range, 25-80 years) were studied. The patients received a liquid test meal, containing 100 mg of 13C-acetate and 12g of lactulose, while they were in the sitting position after an overnight fast. Breath samples were collected at 10-min intervals of 120 min and both 13CO2 and hydrogen (H2) levels were measured. Subsequently, H2 concentrations were measured at 30-min intervals, for a total of 240 min. The results of gastric emptying were expressed as the time of peak 13CO2 excretion. OCTT was defined as the period between the ingestion of lactulose and a H2 peak rise of 5 ppm above the baseline value. The onset of H2 enrichment in the breath began at 90-110 min, whereas 13CO2 levels increased from the beginning, with peak enrichment values being reached after 60-80 min.

The current report analyses the expression pattern of ICAM-1 in primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and in the rat lung following instillation of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) in order to better define the role of alveolar epithelial ICAM-1. AECs stimulated in vitro with LPS were evaluated for ICAM-1 and ICAM-1 messenger ribonucleic acid content. Adherence assays with neutrophils and macrophages were performed. Endotoxin-induced ICAM-1 upregulation on AECs was demonstrated in vivo by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, the effect of intratracheally-instilled anti-ICAM-1 was assessed. Significant upregulation of ICAM-1 occurred in vitro and in vivo on AECs after LPS stimulation. Adherence assays showed a 114% increase in adhesion of neutrophils to AECs. Antibody directed against ICAM-1 reduced this adhesion by 40%. A significant reduction in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and whole lung was seen under airway ICAM-1 blockade.

Seventy asymptomatic patients were studied up to 12 days after first Q wave anterior myocardial infarction and again after 6 months. Each patient had LV volume measured by all three techniques within 24 hours of each other on each occasion. LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume index (LVESVI and LVEDVI) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured using the modified Simpson formula (echo), a counts-based method (RNV), and a multislice area summation method (MRI). Radionuclide volumes were measured both with and without correction for attenuation of isotope. Echocardiography overestimated LV volume compared with MRI.

The studies were classified as type 1 (placebo control), type 2 (nonsteroidal therapy control), type 3 (comparator inhaled corticosteroid control) or type 4 (\"real-life\" studies with dose adjustment). The design attributes of these studies were then compared with the recommendations described in the first part of this review. Of the 18 studies identified, 17 were susceptible to one or more important confounding factors. Nevertheless, the outcomes of all 18 studies were mostly consistent. At recommended doses, beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide demonstrated a small degree of growth suppression over 1-2 yrs (study types 1 and 2), but there was little evidence of such an effect with fluticasone propionate. Studies comparing different inhaled corticosteroids at recommended doses indicated more rapid growth with fluticasone propionate than with beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide. However, none of the inhaled corticosteroids appeared to affect final height.

In addition IL-8 and MCP-1 levels were assessed in the brochoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of seven patients with PAP and compared with those in a group of control subjects (n=5). SP-A, tested over a wide range of concentrations, significantly increased IL-8 and MCP-1 release from monocytes. SP-A retained its activity after collagenase digestion, but was not active after heat treatment. The release of IL-8 by monocytes was also stimulated by Surf. Finally, median BALF IL-8 and MCP-1 levels in PAP patients were significantly higher than in controls (9.50 and 9.51 pg x mL(-1) in controls versus 151.95 and 563.70 pg x mL(-1) in PAP, respectively) and significantly correlated with SP-A concentrations in BALF.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_646_1", "question": "Where is most of the urinary IgG produced in men?", "doc_chunk": "Prospective study of urinary tract infections and urinary antibodies after radical prostatectomy and cystoprostatectomy. The authors have prospectively documented that men who undergo orthotopic bladder substitution more frequently experience bacteriuria than do normal men [19] or men with carcinoma of the prostate scheduled to have radical prostatectomy (see Table 1). Because the frequency of bacteriuria in men after prostatectomy was also lower than that after orthotopic bladder substitution (see Table 1), removal of the prostate and any of its presumed antibacterial properties probably does not account for this difference. Furthermore, the authors' data (see Table 5 ) and that of Woodside and associates [23] demonstrate that intestine incorporated into the genitourinary tract generates a local antibody response against urinary bacteria. Although others have suggested that the incorporation of bowel in the urinary tract may be associated with increased bacteriuria, this effect has never been documented prospectively. The mechanism of this increased frequency of bacteriuria is unknown. Because the anatomy of the male secretory genitourinary system may be altered after radical prostatectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution, the authors evaluated local antibody production before and after these operations. More than 20 years ago, Burdon [5] found that the initial portion of the VB1 sample in men had significantly higher levels of IgA compared with the VB2 specimen, whereas the levels of IgG were similar in the two portions. This latter finding was confirmed by Shorliffe and co-workers [22] when they examined prostatic secretion. Other investigators have found high levels of IgA in human prostatic tissue and fluid. [24,25]. On the basis of these findings, it was believed that, in men, the prostate produces most of the urinary IgA, whereas the bladder or upper urinary tracts make most of the urinary IgG. Although the authors' study confirms that most local urinary tract IgG is produced by the bladder or upper urinary tracts, this study documents that the prostate is not the only source of urethral IgA in men. Despite almost complete removal or prostate secretory epithelium by radical prostatectomy, as evidenced by a dramatic fall in postoperative VB1 and VB2 PSA compared with preoperative levels (Table 3). men who had this operation had only slightly decreased IgA levels after the operation (Table 4, Fig I). The source of this IgA must be urethral because the VB1 urinary stream contains more IgA than the VB2 urine even after radical prostatectomy. The authors have not determined whether the urinary IgA concentrations observed after radical prostatectomy are the true baseline values for a man without a prostate, or whether they actually reflect abnormal production of local IgA stimulated by radical prostatectomy. Because post-prostatectomy bacteriuris occurred frequently during urethral catheter drainage, the authors screened for postoperative IgA titers to mix 1 and mix 2 to determine whether specific production of antibody against gram-negative organisms might account for some of the postoperative IgA measured. Postradical prostatectomy mix 1 and mix 2 titers were not elevated, compared with preoperative measurements. Because urethral glandular tissue other than prostatic tissue is present in the male urethra, these glands also might be responsible for significant local antibody production. The high levels of urinary IgA and IgG after cystoprostatectomy with ileal orthotopic bladder substitution document that intestine incorporated into the urinary tract is still capable of producing local antibody. This observation corresponds with the findings of Mansson and associated [26] of elevated IgA and IgG in ileal reservoir urine compared with normal urinary tracts. It has been estimated that 1 m of intestine may secrete up to 780 mg/d of IgA [27], indicating that normal intestine production of antibody alone can account for the high IgA and IgG levels found in the patients who underwent bladder substitution. Interestingly, the ratio of IgA to IgG concentration in smal intestine fluid is 2:129, similar to the ratio of IgA to IgG in bladder substitution urine (2.92.1:52, Table 4). Because mix 1 and mix 2 IgA concentrations were elevated in VB1 and VB2 urine after ileal bladder substitution (see Table 5), some of this antibody was produced by the ileal bladder substitution in response to the inevitable bacteriuria that occurs during the prolonged postoperative catheter drainage. The findings is absent after radical prostatectomy alone. In addition, some of this increased antibody might be a result of the increased bacteriuria noted in the patients who underwent ileal bladder substitution after the initial postoperative period. The significance of the increased bacteriuria and elevated antibody levels after ileal bladder substitution is unclear. Because most of these episodes of bacteriuria were asymptomatic, whether they represent clinical infections that should be treated is not known. Bishop and associates [28] found that the bacterial flora of ileal conduits with asymptomatic bacteriuria had bacterial counts of 1000 or fewer colonies, and they noted that the healthy ileum in situ may contain more than 10,000 organisms per milliliter [29]. Because the normal urinary tract is usually sterile, it is possible that the bacteriuria found by the authors after ileal bladder substitution represents some form of bowel colonization more commonly associated with the bowel rather than clinical urinary tract infection and has limited clinial importance. Trinchieri and associated [30] found that urinary from patients with ileocystoplasty prevented attachment of E. coli to human uroepithelial cells more effectively that urine from patients with recurrent urinary infections. This observation suggests that the relatively large quantities of Iga produced by the ileal bladder substitution may, in fact, prevent clinical infection by preventing tissue invasion by the bacteria. Only long-term follow-up of patients with ileocystoplasty or ileal bladder substitution will determine the clinical significance of the bacteriuria. The authors' study had documented an increased incidence of bacteriuria in men after ileal bladder substitution and no such increase after radical prostatectomy. Analysis of the data shows that male sources other than the prostate--probably urethral glands-- must produce significant quantities of local urinary tract IgA. After ileal bladder substitution, the incorporated ileum may produce volumes of local antibody that may exceed the amounts ordinarily produce by the normal urinary tract. The clinical significance of the increased incidence of bacteriuria and elevated antibody levels in patients after illeal bladder substitution is unclear.", "answer": "bladder or upper urinary tracts", "covered": false}

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is usually regarded as one of the most serious side-effects of the long-term usage of neuroleptics due to its high prevalence and potentially irreversible nature. Previously, several genetic polymorphisms were investigated for an association with TD in various ethnic populations. Among them, the Ser9Gly variant in the MscI restriction site of the dopamine D3 receptor gene was reported to be associated with TD. We have investigated the association of Ser9Gly polymorphism of the dopamine D3 receptor gene with TD in Korean schizophrenics. The frequencies of the genotypes of Ser/Ser, Ser/Gly and Gly/Gly in 54 schizophrenic patients without TD were 21 (38.9%), 33 (61.1%) and 0 (0%), while the corresponding frequencies in 59 schizophrenic patients with TD were 25 (42.4%), 28 (47.5%) and 6 (10.1%).

Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) complicating the acute phase of myocardial infarction (AMI) is a quite rare event but with short-term unfavorable prognosis. The clinical characteristics as well as the therapeutic implications have not yet been well defined. This paper attempts to prove that VT may be considered a marker of inadequate myocardial perfusion after thrombolysis. To assess the clinic-electroangiographic characteristics and prognosis of patients with VT occurring within the first 4 days of an AMI, a case-control study was carried out in 23 patients from a total of 1,100 patients (1.9%) hospitalized with AMI between March 1993 and July 1997. These patients were compared with a control group of 131 patients hospitalized consecutively. A statistical analysis was made using the chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression. There were no differences among groups with regard to age, gender, and area of necrosis. Average time for the onset of VT was 26 h (range 0-92 h). Sixteen patients underwent coronary angiography: 4 patients had left main coronary artery disease, 2 had single-vessel disease, 8 had lesions in two vessels, and 2 had triple-vessel disease. Univariate analysis showed that patients with VT had a higher incidence of creatine phosphokinase (CPK)-MB peak &gt; 300 UI/l (61 vs. 30%; p&lt;0.001), more frequent occurrence of previous AMI (48 vs. 17%; p&lt;0.001), and acute intraventricular conduction disorders (26 vs. 4%; p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, these patients suffered ischemia previous to VT more frequently (65 vs. 11%; p&lt;0.0001), and had a greater mortality rate than that in the control group (35 vs. 4%; p&lt;0.0001). In the multivariant analysis, the variables related to the occurrence of VT were CPK-MB peak &gt; 300 IU/l (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.6-21), acute intraventricular conduction disorders (OR 9.02; 95% CI 1.7-48), and ischemia immediately prior to VT (odds ratio [OR] 19.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-73).

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of the newly developed low field MRI with the proven methods X-rays and 3P-Sz. 65 patients (47f, 18m; 20-86 yrs) were studied on a one day protocol with 3P-Sz (550 MBq Tc-99m DPD), MRI and X-rays of the hands. Images were visually analysed by two blinded nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists and classified as a) RA-typical, b) inflammatory, non-RA-typical and c) non inflammatory changes.

Tetrahydropapaveroline (THP), a condensation product of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, has been shown to elicit a vasorelaxant response in rat thoracic aorta. This study examined the influence of hypertension on the THP-induced vasorelaxant responsiveness. Ring segments of thoracic aorta were isolated from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and isometric tension development was measured with a force transducer. In aorta, with or without intact endothelium, the contractile responses to potassium chloride (0-120 mM) were comparable between the WKY and the SHR groups. Hypertension did not affect the vasoconstrictive response to norepinephrine (0-10 microM) in vessels with intact endothelium, whereas it attenuated the norepinephrine-induced response in vessels without endothelium. THP (0.1-100 microM) elicited endothelium-intact as well as -denuded vasorelaxation in aorta from both WKY and SHR groups. Interestingly, the THP-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was significantly enhanced, whereas the THP-induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxation was not affected by hypertension.

Glucagon, at least after im administration, induces clear increase in either GH or ACTH and F levels but its effect on somatotroph and corticotroph secretion in obesity has never been studied. In 7 patients with abdominal obesity (OB, aged 24-42 yr, BMI: 29.1-43.9 kg/m2, waist/hip ratio [WHR]: 0.86-1.00) we studied the GH, ACTH and F responses to the im administration of glucagon (0.017 mg/kg at 0 min). The results in OB were compared with those in a group of 6 age-matched controls normal subjects (Ns aged 26-32 yr, BMI 19.7-22.5 kg/m2). In Ns glucagon administration induced clear increase in GH (peak vs baseline, mean+/-SE: 11.6+/-3.4 vs 3.3+/-0.7 microg/l, p&lt;0.02), and ACTH (52.9+/-15.2 vs 19.0+/-1.5 pg/ml, p&lt;0.02) levels which peaked at +150 and +165 min, respectively.

The F response to glucagon in OB and Ns was, however, similar (24057.9+/-4109.1 vs 29835.9+/-1566.0 ng/ml x min). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that in obese patients the im administration of glucagon elicits blunted GH response but exaggerated ACTH increase which is uncoupled with the adrenal response.

The aim of the present study was to search for a sensorimotor marker (i.e., visuopostural tuning) that could be correlated with the severity of motor impairments in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Given that autistic children were previously reported to be posturally hyporeactive to visually perceived environmental motion in comparison with normal control children (Gepner et al., 1995), we sought to determine whether children with Asperger syndrome (AS) would share the same postural hyporeactivity to visual motion. Three autistic children with mild to severe motor impairments, three AS children with soft motor signs, and nine normal control children were tested for overall postural instability and postural reactivity to environmental motion. Results indicate, first, that overall postural instability is significantly reduced in autistic children compared with both AS and normal children. Second, although postural oscillations in the fore-aft axis become more attuned to the oscillation frequency of an immersive dynamic visual display as visual speed is increased, in both control and AS subjects, this is not the case in autistic children. Despite the small number of subjects tested in this study, our data confirm the existence of a visuopostural detuning in autistic children. Third, they argue for a correlation between visuopostural tuning and severity of motor signs in children with autistic spectrum disorders.

There will be times when tensions arise between staff, patients, and family members, especially when the needs of the families and the patients are perceived as being unmet, unacknowledged, or otherwise lacking in importance to the staff. Frustrations, if not addressed and successfully resolved, can lead to conflict and the threat of or incidences of violence. Questions that dialysis unit administrators/managers should ask when considering or revoking visitation privileges are: What are the causes and contributory factors that resulted in the unresolved issues and conflict? Did we clearly communicate our policies and procedures and the consequences for failing to follow them to those accompanying the patient? Did we fail to maintain proper boundaries with the invitee (Allowing the family members to engage in inappropriate behaviors such as threats, cursing, name-calling)? Have we attempted to resolve the issues with the family members? If so, how and what was the outcome? Did we document our actions and the family members' responses? Is the revocation of the visitation privilege the only viable option? If so, why? If not, what else could be done? What steps should be taken to minimize the disruptive effect on the patient, whose family member is being disruptive? What are the reasonable and the required steps that a facility should take to ensure that the patients are properly cared for and free from abuse and neglect? What did we learn from this situation that we could use in future situations? The uncomfortable position that Sacred Heart Hospital found itself in is a difficult one and one that many other clinics have or may experience. The focus on continuing to meet the needs of a patient while dealing with issues, such as those presented here, depicts and represents professionalism at work. Answering these questions before problems arise will help unit administrators be prepared to deal effectively with conflict at the dialysis facility. Having a plan of action in place ensures a suitable, uniform response to unacceptable situations and reduces the risk of reacting inappropriately when those situations arise.", "answer": "Dialysis unit administrators can effectively address tensions and prevent conflicts by clearly communicating policies, maintaining proper boundaries, resolving conflicts effectively, carefully assessing visitation privileges, minimizing disruptions for patients, ensuring patient care, and learning from each situation to improve future responses.", "covered": false}

The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of ependymoma has diminished recently because (1) chemotherapy fails to delay radiation therapy for a meaningful period of time; (2) tumors that progress during chemotherapy do not respond as well to subsequent irradiation; and (3) the combination of chemotherapy and irradiation does not improve overall survival. However, chemotherapy may make residual tumor more amenable to a second resection. Fewer than 50% of pediatric patients with ependymoma undergo complete resection before receiving radiation therapy.

Update on disease assessment. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a multisystem immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation of exocrine glands leading to clinical symptoms of dryness, particularly of the eyes and mouth which can be severe and disabling. It can occur in association with other rheumatic disorders or as a primary entity (PSS), often associated with B-cell hyperreactivity manifested by hypergammaglobulinaemia and anti-Ro and/or anti-La autoantibodies. These patients are more likely to have systemic involvement, for example of the pulmonary, neurological or haematological systems, and have a 44 times increased risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, this being the major adverse outcome in this disorder. Clinical trials of new therapies in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been advanced by the development of internationally agreed assessment and outcome measures such as the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR core datasets of disease activity in RA and measures of activity and damage in SLE such as BILAG, SLEDAI, SLICC etc. No such equivalent consensus exists for SS and as a result clinical trials have all used different, unvalidated, ad hoc measures of disease assessment and outcome. One attempt to bring a coherent approach to this issue is the \"Copenhagen model\" or disease assessment wheel that places each disease manifestation within specific categories depending on their presumed pathogenesis. Attempts have also been made to develop this into a severity tool by grading specific manifestations according to severity. In March 2000, interested specialists from around Europe met to develop a consensus on the broad principles underpinning disease assessment in SS (particularly PSS). It was agreed to adopt the international approach of dividing assessment into: exocrine and-nonexocrine disease activity (potentially reversible and including sicca symptoms and objective measures and systemic symptoms (particularly fatigue) and clinical features), damage (present for over 6 months), health-related and generic quality of life, and standard approaches to adverse events/toxicity and health economic aspects. The workshop also began the process of developing specific measures of sicca symptoms and systemic activity and damage. In order to convert this approach into detailed, experimentally validated assessment tools, a UK-based collaboration has focused on the development of systemic and sicca symptom questionnaires and a prospective evaluation in Europe of systemic activity and damage measures is planned.", "answer": "non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "covered": false}

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_1091_0", "question": "What are the different types of ocular allergic disorders mentioned in the text?", "doc_chunk": "Ocular allergy guidelines: a practical treatment algorithm. The treatment of ocular allergy requires a better understanding of the spectrum of clinical disorders involving various components of the immune system, and of interactions at the conjunctival surface. The immune response focuses primarily on the different levels of activity of Th2 lymphocytes and various other immune cells associated with allergic disorders, including mast cells, eosinophils, fibroblasts, and epithelial and endothelial cells. Ocular allergic disorders include seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), which, through immunopathological and molecular immunological techniques, can all be better appreciated as being part of a larger spectrum of an atopic disease state. In SAC, pathological changes, such as increased mast-cell activation, the presence of migratory inflammatory cells, and early signs of cellular activation at the molecular level, are minimal. In PAC, these changes are more pronounced in line with the increased duration of allergenic stimulation. In more chronic forms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as VKC in children and AKC in adults, the following changes are evident: a persistent state of mast cell, eosinophil and lymphocyte activation; noted switching from connective-tissue to mucosal-type mast cells; increased involvement of corneal pathology; and follicular development and fibrosis. The treatment of acute and more chronic forms of allergic conjunctivitis has focused in the past on symptomatic relief of symptoms, but with a better understanding of the mechanisms involved we can now provide interventional therapeutic strategies and symptomatic relief. Our advances in the basic understanding of these conditions are providing the foundation for guidelines that improve the ocular health of patients with ocular allergies.", "answer": "Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC).", "covered": false}

Dorsal carpal osteochondral injury is a major cause of lameness in horses undergoing high intensity training. Intra-articular corticosteroid treatment is used commonly to manage exercise-associated articular pain, but its use remains highly controversial in the equine athlete. This project, therefore, aimed to compare the mechanical properties of intra-articular MPA and diluent-treated middle carpal subchondral and cancellous bone in horses undergoing a short-term treadmill exercise programme. It was hypothesised that subchondral and cancellous bone mechanical properties are influenced by intra-articular administration of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA). Eight 2-year-old female horses had MPA or diluent administered into contralateral middle carpal joints at 14 day intervals, for a total of 4 treatments per horse. Horses underwent a standard treadmill exercise protocol until euthanasia (Day 70). Standard sites were located on the dorsal aspect of third, radial and intermediate carpal bones. Osteochondral samples from each test site were divided into subchondral bone and cancellous bone portions. These were dried, resin-embedded and gold-coated. Microhardness measurements were obtained at each test site. No significant effect of intra-articular treatment was detected. At each site, cancellous bone trabecular struts had an 18-19% higher microhardness value than the overlying subchondral bone. These findings indicate that intra-articular administration of MPA at this dose has no effect on subchondral or cancellous bone adaptation to short-term exercise and, therefore, on the propensity of carpal bones to injury.

This open clinical study was designed to investigate the occurrence of adverse reactions of specific immunotherapy (SIT) with horse dander and to recognize signs of efficacy regarding horse-induced cutaneous and respiratory symptoms. Twenty-four patients attending our Outpatient Clinic in Huelva (Spain) with horse-induced allergy were selected for receiving a standardized extract of horse dander (Alutard SQ). Local and systemic reactions (five adverse reactions in four patients) were observed during the induction phase of treatment when administering the doses with the highest allergen concentration. Systemic side effects were mild, one immediate case consisting of wheezing and prompt response to treatment and one mild conjunctival hyperemia. Doses were reduced in all cases, and good tolerance to SIT was maintained. The sensitivity of patients to horse dander as assessed by deliberate natural exposure to horse decreased significantly when patients reached maintenance dose: Conjunctivitis symptoms were reduced in all patients, rhinitic symptoms in 93%, asthmatic symptoms in 90%, and cutaneous symptoms in 87% of the patients. Subjective assessment of a patient's allergic disease on a visual analog scale (VAS) showed an improvement. Ninety-five percent of the patients were highly satisfied with the treatment (efficacy, suitability, and troubles).

Capillary electrophoretic separations of inorganic anions are performed using a capillary coated with a mixture of the cationic surfactant didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) and the zwitterionic surfactant 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC). These double-chained surfactants form semi-permanent coatings on the capillary wall, which allows the excess surfactant to be removed from the buffer prior to separation. Interactions between surfactant aggregates in the buffer and analyte anions are thus eliminated. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) can be altered from fully reversed (100% DDAB) to near zero (100% DLPC) using different ratios of DDAB and DLPC. Controlling the EOF allows for improved resolution of the anions while maintaining a rapid, co-EOF separation, free from analyte-surfactant additive interactions.", "answer": "Inorganic anions are separated in capillary electrophoresis using surfactant coatings by controlling the electroosmotic flow through varying ratios of DDAB and DLPC, which adjusts the EOF from fully reversed to nearly zero, enhancing anion resolution and preventing interactions with surfactant aggregates.", "covered": false}

Unlike the many chemotherapeutic agents that do not effectively stop blood flow or induce necrosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, AC-7700 has been shown to inhibit tubulin polymerization and selectively stop tumor blood flow. The aim of this study was to elucidate the antivascular and antitumor effects of AC-7700 on rat hepatoma. AH-130 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, were solidified and implanted into the liver of Donryu rats. Vascularity of the liver tumor was directly identified by in-vivo fluorescence microscopy from 0 to 60 min after the injection of 10 mg/kg AC-7700. To observe the antivascular effect of AC-7700, the vascular density of the tumor was measured and assessed as the ratio of preinjection to postinjection values. The antitumor effects were evaluated with histopathologic findings and analysis of animal survival. In-vivo microscopic observation showed that tumor perfusion diminished within 30 min after AC-7700 administration. Vascular density in the AC-7700 group was significantly less than that in the control group at 60 min (AC-7700, 26.3 +/- 16.4%; control, 88.5 +/- 9.2%; P &lt; 0.001).

The effect of adsorption to elemental iron on the reductive transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (royal demolition explosive [RDX]) in aqueous solution was studied with scrap iron and high-purity iron. In batch experiments with the same total iron surface area and a mixing rate of 100 rpm, TNT and RDX were removed from the solution within 30 min. With high-purity iron, adsorbed TNT was reduced to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (TAT) rapidly, with little accumulation of intermediates at the surface. With scrap iron, the extent of adsorption of TNT and its daughter products was more significant and reduction of these adsorbed molecules to TAT was slower. Distribution of the intermediates indicated that the reaction with scrap iron occurred primarily through reduction of the ortho nitro group. Kinetic analysis suggests that mass transfer or adsorption of TNT controlled the overall rate of TNT reduction to TAT with pure iron, whereas with scrap iron, the rate of TAT formation was probably limited by other processes. Compared to TNT, transformation of adsorbed RDX was more rapid and less affected by iron type.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a tetrameric enzyme that has been used as a model for labile protein drugs. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) have been proposed as excipients to stabilize labile proteins in solution and during the freezing portion of the lyophilization cycle. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PEG molecular weight and concentration on the activity of LDH. In general, PEG protection increases with PEG molecular weight and concentration. PEGs slow the loss of activity in LDH solutions stored at 4 degrees C, but are not sufficiently effective to allow for a solution product. PEGs 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 show full freezing protection at less than 0.01%, while lower molecular weight PEGs need higher concentrations to produce protection upon freezing. Circular dichroism (CD) studies of LDH solutions before and after freezing with PEG 400 and PEG 8000 confirm the activity studies. The CD spectrum of LDH before freezing shows the classic alpha helix pattern. After unprotected LDH solution is frozen and thawed, the CD spectrum erodes. Low concentrations of PEG 8000 (1% or less) preserve the alpha helix profile after freezing of the samples.

Current algal test protocols do not distinguish between chemical toxicity and growth inhibition due to physical shading when coloured substances like dyes are evaluated. To eliminate the interfering physical effect, we investigated the importance of light intensity and culture volume in the algal growth inhibition tests with Desmodesmus subspicatus and three selected dyestuffs. A photon flux density above light saturation is needed to prevent inhibition of algal growth solely due to the light absorption by dyes. Furthermore, a smaller culture volume and moderate shaking of the test flasks is advantageous in that these conditions decrease the influence of the light absorption. At 120 microE s(-1) m(-2), the shading effect of three tested dyes could be eliminated, up to a concentration of 100 mg l(-1). In a mixture with a blue dyestuff, the model toxicant potassium dichromate showed nearly the same EC50 as if applied alone, indicating that the impact of the dye was negligible. Also a small culture volume decreases the inhibition of the average growth rate of Desmodesmus. Thus, by increasing the light intensity and optionally also reducing the culture volume, this method allows a more direct measure of a potential inherent chemical toxicity of coloured substances to algae. Additionally, high light intensities and lower culture volumes result in lower coefficients of variation, which improves the sensitivity of the test for the statistical calculation of toxicity data.", "answer": "Increase light intensity above light saturation and reduce culture volume.", "covered": false}

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_642_1", "question": "Why is it important for a tumor marker to have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis?", "doc_chunk": "Current concepts of tumor markers in bladder cancer. The critical issue in characterizing the usefulness of tumor markers in screening or monitoring for urothelial cancer and in determining prognosis revolves around the question, \"What do we need to know?\" During surveillance of patients with low-risk disease, highly sensitive markers may detect disease persistence or early recurrence (on the basis of field-effect changes or tumor cell implantation); however, they may not indicate the possibility of progression. If cystoscopy is negative in these instances, is it appropriate to treat? Does earlier treatment actually prevent recurrence or progression? Some investigators have suggested a positive answer to the former question, although lead-time bias may a role. The issue in the latter question may be moot because low-risk disease is by definition unlikely to progress. A corresponding question is whether one should treat the patient if the marker has a low specificity. In such instances, a marker with low specificity may incur more frequent instrumentation and a panoply of additional costs. A marker may have some value in providing earlier diagnosis in low-risk disease if treatments are available to prevent clinical expression and recurrence. A tumor marker would have additional value if it could detect biologic change from low-risk to high-risk disease and permit a corresponding change in treatment. Moreover, if a marker could provide earlier diagnosis in high-risk disease, it might permit identification of those patients likely to progress at earlier and curable stages of disease. To be successful, such markers must have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis. It has been suggested that \"a simple noninvasive highly sensitive and specific method for detecting bladder cancer would decrease the morbidity associated with current surveillance methods, improve quality of life for patients, and reduce costs by substituting a less expensive test for the more expensive endoscopic procedures\" (Dr. M. Soloway, personal communication 2000). In considering this statement, it is tempting to question some of its implications. The term \"simple\" suggests that point-of-care tests may be the easiest, but tests that are available may be inconsistent and not sufficiently sensitive or specific. The need for a \"highly sensitive and specific\" test is of critical importance for applicability in the individual, even when such tests are based on the results in large populations. When considering the \"morbidity of current methods,\" it is tempting to question whether cystoscopy is that morbid a procedure. Given the information it provides, it seems improbable that it can be readily replaced. Currently, no markers provide information over and above that provided by cystoscopy and histology- or cytology-based understanding of the biology of the disease especially in considering distinctions between low-risk and high-risk disease. The ability to \"improve quality of life\" will depend on the use of the predictive value made on the basis of a test's sensitivity and specificity. A false-positive test may lead to anxiety and extensive unnecessary evaluation, whereas a false-negative test may lead to missed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and the possibility of disease progression until accurate diagnosis is obtained. In each case, quality of life is compromised. \"Substituting a less expensive test\" depends on the benefits of that substitution and the practicality of omitting or delaying standard assessment. Costs depend on the frequency of testing, those incurred by false-positive tests, and those incurred by false-negative tests. Several caveats emerge when taking into account these various considerations. In screening for low-risk disease, the urgency of diagnosis may be less important. High sensitivity is of less importance because the risk of a missed diagnosis has less ominous repercussions. Nevertheless, high specificity is important to avoid unnecessary frequent instrumentations. In considering surveillance for low-risk disease, cytology may be more useful in indicating a change from negative (persistent or recurrent low-risk disease) to positive (high-risk disease) with the consequent need for more aggressive treatment approach. No urinary \"screening\" markers reliably provide this information. In considering surveillance for high-risk disease, sensitive markers would detect persistence or early recurrence. If such markers are negative, intervals between repeated cystoscopies may be prolonged; however, a high specificity is needed to ensure the validity of a truly negative interpretation. Otherwise, diagnosis may be missed and the risk from progression and the development of incurability increased. Markers for urothelial cancer must be expressed exclusively as a consequence of the presence of cancer cells. The test must be sensitive in detecting disease and must be validated in nonselected populations. It must be sensitive in excluding nondisease, and noncancer conditions must have little influence on its accuracy. There must be little or no interassay or intra-assay variability. Interpretation of an assay for a tumor marker should be all or none, or based on a threshold level. The assays must have sufficient sensitivity and specificity in populations and in the individual to have practical clinical applicability.", "answer": "It is important for a tumor marker to have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis to ensure accurate detection of cancer and to avoid unnecessary treatments and procedures.", "covered": false}

It is possible that lycopene is one of the compounds in raw and processed tomato products that may contribute to a lower risk of prostate cancer; however, this hypothesis remains to be further investigated. Other carotenoids and phytochemicals in tomato products may also contribute to the proposed health benefits. Food processing does not seem to reduce the benefits but may, in fact, enhance the bioavailability of beneficial components. The reported correlations or associations between the consumption of tomato products and prostate cancer risk should not be interpreted as causal until additional data are available from a variety of studies in different populations. Ideally, randomized controlled intervention studies would provide an ultimate test of the tomato/lycopene hypothesis; however, the expense, long duration of exposure, and the near universal consumption of tomato products among Americans make a dietary intervention study difficult to undertake. It is reasonable to recommend to the general population the consumption of tomato products at approximately one serving per day or five servings per week as part of an overall healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risks of prostate cancer, other malignancies, or other chronic diseases. This recommendation is consistent with current dietary guidelines to increase fruit and vegetable consumption to lower the risk of heart disease and many types of cancer [38].

Platinum concentrations in topsoil samples collected in 1992 (48) and in 2001 (16) from the urban area of Rome have been determined by ICP-MS. Concentrations in 47 soil samples collected in 1992 from natural sites of Latium (an area around Rome) have been determined for a first assessment of natural background levels. The Pt concentrations in Rome urban soils collected in 1992 range from 0.8 to 6.3 ng/g (mean = 3.8 +/- 1.0) overlapping the concentration range of natural soils from Latium (mean = 3.1 +/- 2.1 ng/g). No significant correlation has generally been found between Pt contents in the 'natural' soils and related bedrock or major pedogenetic parameters. These results suggest that there is no evidence of Pt pollution in Rome urban soils at that time, because the massive use of the automobile catalytic converter has only just started. Higher (up to six times more) Pt concentrations, than those measured in the 1992 samples, have been measured, in some cases, in Rome urban soils collected in 2001, suggesting a possible start of Pt accumulation because of the large-scale use in the last decade of automobile catalytic converters. At the same time, a clear decrease of lead levels in Rome urban soils with respect to the levels measured in 1992 has been observed, paralleling the decreasing number of lead gasoline-fuelled cars.

The key pharmacological action for the clinical use of bisphosphonates lies in the inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Osteoblasts could be other target cells for bisphosphonates. We studied the effects of bisphosphonates on the proliferation and the differentiation of normal human bone trabecular osteoblastic cells (hOB). We tested 4 different compounds: clodronate, pamidronate and 2 newer compounds: ibandronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate and zoledronate, which is a heterocyclic imidazole compound. Ibandronate and zoledronate stimulated hOB cell proliferation by up to 30% (p&lt;0.05) after 72 h for concentrations ranging from 10(-8) M to 10(-5) M. Clodronate transiently enhanced hOB cell survival after only 24 h (+60%, p&lt;0.001) whereas pamidronate had no effect. Longer time course studies, in presence of fetal calf serum, revealed that cell growth was finally reduced by all 4 bisphosphonates (40% after 7 days). Type I collagen synthesis was transiently increased by all 4 bisphosphonates after only 48 h incubation (+17% to +67%, p&lt;0.05).

In conclusion, we found that different bisphosphonates, currently used or tested in various clinical conditions, transiently stimulated the growth of preosteoblastic cells and thereafter increased their differentiation according to sequential events (type I collagen synthesis first, then ALP activity to a lesser extent).

Much less common is white superficial onychomycosis (WSO), which appears as white, chalky deposits on the surface of the affected nail plate. [20] WSO is easily scraped away with a curette or rotary burr. [21] The rarest subtype of onychomycosis is proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), which develops overlying the nail matrix.

At each of the nAChR subtypes, high affinity binding was dependent on the presence of a 3-substituted pyridine, and the other isomers, 5 and 6, resulted in marked decreases in binding affinities. The second class of compounds is based on replacing the pyridyl unit of 1 with a diazine moiety, giving pyridazine (7), pyrimidine (8), and pyrazine (9), which retain the \"3-pyridyl\" substructure. Modest reductions in binding affinity were observed for all of the diazine ligands at all nAChR subtypes, with the exception of 7, which retained potency comparable to that of 4 in binding to alpha7 nAChR. In functional assays at the alpha3beta4 nAChR, all analogues 4-9 were less potent, as compared with 1, and the rank order of functional potencies correlated with that of binding potencies. Computational studies indicate that the 3-substituted pyridine 4 and 2-substituted pyridine 5, as well as the diazine analogues 7-9, all conform to a distance-based pharmacophore model recently proposed for the alpha4beta2 receptor. However, the nicotinic potencies of these ligands vary considerably and because 5 lacks appreciable nicotinic activity, it is clear that further refinements of this model are necessary in order to describe adequately the structural and electronic demands associated with this nAChR subtype. This rational series of compounds based on UB-165 presents a systematic approach to defining subtype specific pharmacophores.", "answer": "The second class of compounds involved replacing the pyridyl unit with a diazine moiety, and these compounds generally showed modest reductions in binding affinity at all nAChR subtypes, except for pyridazine (7) which retained comparable potency to deschloro UB-165 at the alpha7 subtype.", "covered": false}

The proportion of dental students in Newcastle drinking above the recommended low risk limits of alcohol declined from 47% as second year students to 25% as final year students and then it increased to 41% as qualified dentists, whilst in medical students it steadily increased over the three time points of the survey (33% to 43% to 54%). A greater proportion of dental students were drinking at hazardous levels at all three time-points, compared with medical students. Experimentation with illicit drugs ranged from 47% as second year students to 54% as final year students and to 51% as dentists. The prevalence of illicit drug use in medical students was similar to that in dental students. Forty seven per cent of the dental student cohort as second year students, 67% as final year students and 16% as dentists suffered from possible pathological anxiety, compared with 47%, 26% and 30% in the medical student cohort. The proportion of dentists suffering from stress decreased from 72% as final year students to 19% as dentists. In the medical student group, the proportion increased from 32% as final year students to 39% as PRHOs. This longitudinal study revealed that a high proportion of dental students from Newcastle continue to drink excessively and experiment with illicit drugs both as undergraduates and as practising dentists.

Chromium is a primary drinking water contaminant in the USA with hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), being the most toxic form of the metal. As a required step in developing a revised state drinking water standard for chromium, the California Department of Health Services recently issued a new Public Health Goal (PHG) of 2.5 microg/l for total chromium and 0.2 microg/l for Cr(VI). Hexavalent chromium can be determined (as chromate) by ion chromatography, as described in US Evironmental Protection Agency Method 218.6; however, the method as originally published does not allow sufficient sensitivity for analysis at the California PHG level of 0.2 microg/l. Modification of the conditions described in Method 218.6, including the use of a lower eluent flow-rate, larger reaction coil, and larger injection volume, significantly increases the method sensitivity. The modified method, which uses IonPac NG1 and AS7 guard and analytical columns, an eluent of 250 mM ammonium sulfate-100 mM ammonium hydroxide operated at 1.0 ml/min, a 1000 microl injection volume, and postcolumn reaction with 2 mM diphenylcarbazide-10% methanol-0.5 M sulfuric acid (using a 750 microl reaction coil) followed by UV-Vis detection at 530 nm, permits a method detection limit for chromate of 0.02 microg/l.

This objective was accomplished by monitoring the environmental concentrations of TCS, higher chlorinated derivatives of TCS (4,5-dichloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol [tetra II]; 5,6-dichloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol [tetra III]; and 4,5,6-trichloro-2-(2,4-dichloro-phenoxy)-phenol [penta]), and a potential biotransformation by-product of TCS (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dicholoro-phenoxy]-anisole [TCS-OMe]) during wastewater treatment. These analytes were isolated from wastewater by using a C18 solid-phase extraction column and from sludge with supercritical fluid CO2. Once the analytes were isolated, they were derivatized to form trimethylsilylethers before quantitation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Recovery of TCS from laboratory-spiked wastewater samples ranged from 79 to 88% for influent, 36 to 87% for final effluent, and 70 to 109% for primary sludge. Field concentrations of TCS in influent wastewater ranged from 3.8 to 16.6 microg/L and concentrations for final effluent ranged from 0.2 to 2.7 microg/L. Removal of TCS by activated-sludge treatment was approximately 96%, whereas removal by trickling-filter treatment ranged from 58 to 86%.

Digested sludge concentrations of TCS ranged from 0.5 to 15.6 microg/g (dry wt), where the lowest value was from an aerobic digestion process and the highest value was from an anaerobic digestion process. Analysis of these results suggests that TCS is readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions, but not under anaerobic conditions.

Metal adsorption and surface charge determinations were performed previously on well-characterised Sphagnum and Carex peat samples. The aim of this investigation was to determine metal adsorption from complex wastewaters onto these peat samples and compare it to the adsorption onto peat granules, clinoptilolite, glauconite and a flue dust from steel production. A sulphide mine leachate, a landfill leachate and a laundry wastewater were chosen, giving a variation in pH, ionic strength, total organic carbon and concentrations of metals. Metal adsorption was determined in batch and column experiments. The wastewater composition was of great importance for metal removal efficiency, mainly due to the difference in dominating metal species. In the sulphide mine leachate, containing free metal ions, a high metal adsorption was observed onto both peat and inorganic adsorbents. In the landfill leachate the metals formed carbonate and organic complexes and a low metal removal was achieved. Contrary to the leachates, the laundry wastewater contained suspended particles. The high amount of metals removed, 80% of the Cu and 30-60% of the Zn concentration, was probably withdrawn bound to the particle fraction. The highest removal of metal ions was obtained in the sulphide mine leachate with Carex peat, removing 97-99% of the Zn and 85-100% of the Cu content. The Sphagnum peat sample removed 37-77% of the Zn and 80-100% of the Cu content.

To examine the effects of sociodemographic, family, and peer predictors on the developmental patterns of illicit drug initiation from ages 12 to 21 years. A gender-balanced, ethnically diverse urban sample of 808 children in Seattle was surveyed at age 10 in 1985 and followed prospectively to age 21 in 1996. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to assess the effects of sociodemographic, family, and peer factors on the risk of initiation. The risk for initiating illicit drug use increased steadily from ages 12 to 21. High family conflict, low family bonding, and high peers' antisocial activities predicted higher risk of initiation across this developmental period. The effect of family bonding began to decline after age 18, while the effect of peers' antisocial activities began to increase after age 15. Few gender and ethnic differences were found. Prevention programs need to include family and peer factors as important targets.

A promising approach in adoptive immunotherapy is based on the induction of a specific cellular anti-tumor response by antigen-specific, cytolytic T cells. Due to difficulties in isolating tumor-specific T cells in sufficient amounts, it was proposed to graft cytolytic T cells with an antigen-specific, recombinant T cell receptor. The antigen binding domain of the receptor consists of a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) that is derived from a monoclonal antibody and binds to a tumor associated antigen. The intracellular signalling domain is derived from the cytoplasmic part of a membrane bound receptor to induce cellular activation, e.g., the Fc epsilon RI receptor gamma-chain or the CD3 zeta-chain. By use of this type of recombinant receptor, the strategy combines the advantages of MHC-independent, antibody-based antigen binding with efficient T cell activation upon specific binding to the receptor ligand. The modular composition of the receptor, moreover, facilitates modification of both the antigen binding and signalling properties. Accordingly, we and others have generated a panel of recombinant T cell receptors with specificities for malignantly or virally transformed cells. Receptor grafted effector cells were demonstrated to mediate a highly efficient immune response towards antigen expressing target cells. However, little is known about the impact of the recombinant receptor modules on recognition of highly heterologous target antigens and on cellular activation in a complex immunological context.

The problem of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty remains the major limiting factor of the procedure. Over the last 10 years, investigators have been studying the use of radiation therapy for preventing restenosis after angioplasty or stent placement. Since radiotherapy has been proven in other cases to be effective in disrupting the cell cycle regulatory proteins and thereby slowing or stopping growth, it was decided to apply the same principle to neointimal hyperplasia. To review the data that have emerged regarding vascular radiation with an emphasis on irradiated stents, 65 articles were reviewed and both preclinical and clinical experiments were included. Overall, studies with gamma and beta radiation show promising results. Endovascular gamma radiation has been shown effective in randomized trials, even at 3-year follow-up. Beta radiation is preferred because of greater safety and localization, and because it has also shown encouraging results in initial clinical trials, as well as in larger randomized studies. Consequently, the Federal Drug Administration has approved the use of both. In both types of endovascular brachytherapy, it seems the greater the dose, the better the initial response. Safety concerns include an increased incidence of late thrombosis and greater restenosis at margins. With irradiated stents, however, the situation is not as clear. At times, animal models have presented confusing results. These have ranged from significant suppression of hyperplasia to outright adverse effects of radiation on the vessel wall. While some clinical trials have been encouraging, others have not. Follow-up of up to 1 year has been disappointing so far. Many issues, such as the \"candy wrapper\" effect and rebound hyperplasia, must be dealt with before this becomes a viable form of therapy.

The superior constrictor muscle originates from the pterygoid process, posterior end of the mylohyoid line of mandible, and the pterygomandibular ligament/raphe. This superior constrictor muscle inserts into the base of the skull at the pharyngeal tubercle and the pharyngeal raphe. The pharyngeal raphe is a midline tendinous seam where the constrictor muscles meet. When the superior constrictor muscle contracts, it constricts the upper portion of the pharynx. The middle constrictor muscle originates from the greater and lesser horn of the hyoid bone and stylohyoid ligament. The middle constrictor inserts into the median pharyngeal raphe as well as blending in with fibers of the superior and inferior constrictors. The middle constrictor muscle contracts to constrict the middle portion of the pharynx. The inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle further divides into two muscles, the thyropharyngeus, and the cricopharyngeus muscle. The thyropharyngeus muscle originates from the thyroid cartilage and inserts into the median pharyngeal raphe. The cricopharyngeus muscle originates from the cricoid cartilage and blends into the esophageal muscle. When the inferior constrictors contract, they constrict the lower portion of the pharynx. These constrictor muscles work together and contract to push food after swallowing to propel it from the oral cavity into the esophagus. [7]", "answer": "Cricoid cartilage.", "covered": true}

Sodium carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases are preferred over sodium hydroxide for anion analysis by suppressor-based ion chromatography (IC). Unlike hydroxide, carbonate-hydrogencarbonate has strong eluting power and its buffering capacity can be used as a selectivity tool for controlling separations. However, carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases fell out of favor for trace level analysis because the carbonic acid suppressor effluent has some background conductivity, which reduces sensitivity compared to sodium hydroxide. This paper describes a new suppressor technology that improved anion analysis with carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases. In addition to converting the carbonate-hydrogencarbonate buffer to carbonic acid like other traditional IC suppressors, the new DS-Plus suppressor also removed carbonic acid from the suppressor effluent. Anions are now detected in water background, just like when using sodium hydroxide as the mobile phase. The lower background conductivity improves sensitivity and reduces detection limits.

Stormwater runoff was monitored on 13 separate urban watersheds, which were chosen to represent distinct types of residential and industrial development, along with various watershed characteristics. A total of 38 storm events were monitored to investigate the first flush phenomenon. The first flush phenomenon may be defined as the initial period of stormwater runoff during which the concentration of pollutants is substantially higher than during later stages. The magnitude of the first flush phenomenon, and if it actually occurs, was calculated using a method of data analysis which results in determining the 'event mean concentration' (EMC). The magnitude of the first flush phenomenon was found to be greater for some pollutants (e.g. suspended solids from residential areas) and less for others (e.g. chemical oxygen demand from industrial areas). No correlation was observed between the first flush phenomenon and the antecedent dry weather period, however, the first flush phenomenon was greater for smaller watershed areas.", "answer": "The magnitude of the first flush phenomenon was determined using the 'event mean concentration' (EMC).", "covered": false}

The benzamide chromophore is widely used as a Cottonogenic derivative of primary amines for stereochemical studies by circular dichroism.

By the use of benzoyl derivatives of amino alcohols (1-4) and diamines (5, 6) of known absolute configuration we demonstrate that the 250-210 nm range exciton Cotton effects due to secondary and tertiary benzamides are generally of opposite sign. The origin of such disparity is traced to different conformational equilibria of the amide C-N bond in secondary and tertiary benzamides, as shown by semiempirical molecular modelling and NMR data.

High-titer alphavirus vectors have been generated for efficient gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Studies on CNS infection via intranasal and peripheral injections with virulent and avirulent replication-competent Semliki Forest virus (SFV) strains has demonstrated the potential of gene delivery. Replication-deficient alphavirus particles have shown high local transgene expression of a transient nature in rodent brain. Alphavirus vectors have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in infected human tumor cell lines and SFV vectors expressing interleukin-12 resulted in tumor regression in a B16 murine melanoma model. Repeated SFV injections led to stronger anti-tumor effects without immunogenic response detected against SFV. It has also been shown that intra-tumoral SFV-injections into nude mice with implanted human lung carcinomas led to tumor regression. Likewise, injection of replicative SFV-LacZ RNA resulted in tumor response as well as prophylactic protection against tumor formation. Alphaviruses have also showed potential in vaccine production. Additionally, modifications in the envelope structure of Sindbis virus resulted in substantial change in host range and demonstrated the feasibility of targeting alphavirus vectors. Moreover, SFV has been used as an expression vector for the generation of high-titer retrovirus-like particles. Recent alphavirus vector development has introduced novel non-cytopathogenic vectors, tightly temperature-regulated vectors as well as replication-persistent forms that should prolong the duration of expression. Alphavirus vectors can therefore be considered as highly potential gene delivery vehicles for future gene therapy applications, especially where only short-term expression is required, or even preferred.", "answer": "The studies demonstrated the potential of gene delivery by showing efficient gene delivery into the CNS using SFV strains.", "covered": false}

{"id": "article-28422_0_1", "question": "Which components and mechanisms play a role in the respiration process?", "doc_chunk": "Physiology, Respiratory Rate -- Introduction. Respiration is a vital process for the normal function at every level of organization from a cell to an organism; oxygen, supplied by local circulation at the tissue level, functions at the mitochondrial internal membrane as an essential mediator for the energy release. In mitochondria, digested nutrients undergo metabolic reactions, end up at the level of the electron transport chain, and release high-energy compounds (ATP). The main byproduct of this process, carbon dioxide, gets released in the venous blood returning to the lungs. Carbon dioxide diffuses through alveolar walls and dissolves in the exhaled amount of air. The respiratory rate, i.e., the number of breaths per minute, is highly regulated to enable cells to produce the optimum amount of energy at any given occasion. A complex nervous system of nerve tissues regulates the rate of oxygen inflow and carbon dioxide outflow. It adjusts it accordingly in conditions that tend to derange partial gas pressures in blood. Respiration is a process involving the brain, brainstem, respiratory muscles, lungs, airways, and blood vessels. All these structures have involvement structurally, functionally, and regulatory to respiration.", "answer": "The structures and systems involved in respiration include the brain, brainstem, respiratory muscles, lungs, airways, and blood vessels.", "covered": true}

Ever since the first decades of the 20th century, some authors have given respiratory infection triggered by bacteria an etiologic role in bronchial asthma, focusing on infection and the asthmatic response. In 1995 our group already presented a study in this sense on nasal secretion cultures and the relationship between IgE and sensitization to allergens. There is a significant association between patients with sensitization to Dermatophagoides, high levels of total IgE, and positive culture to Staphylococcus aureus. Following studies by Norn, we performed a study with 40 children, aged 2-14 years, where we observed that children with sensitization to mites and a positive culture had higher levels of histamine release than did children with negative culture and controls, the differences being significant. We also found, like other authors, that the joint presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Derrmatophagoides pteronyssinus potentiates antigen-specific histamine release. In recent years, with the increasing prevalence of bronchial asthma being studied, the role that infection could play in this increase is being considered again among other factors. As participants of the ISAAC project and using the same methods as in this study, we performed a simultaneous questionnaire with questions related with triggering and contributing factors, etc., including respiratory infection. We found an association between having had more than three episodes of \"bronchitis\" with fever and lasting for longer than seven days in the last year and having ever had asthma (OR 29.09). This association is still greater with having had wheezing in the last 12 months (OR 43.26), a finding that it is also associated with requiring attention in an emergency room (OR 30.65). From these results, we concluded that respiratory infection is an aggravating factor of asthma, something we already knew. In order to have our own experience, we studied serum interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) in a sample of 41 children aged 3 to 17 years. The most frequent values of IL-4 ranged between 0.25 and 0.40 ng, and very low dispersion was found in the sample, which did not allow correlation with other parameters. Regarding IFNgamma, we found values between &lt; 5 pg/ml and 605 pg/ml.

This significance is not found if children who have been under immunotherapy for less than one year are included. When we studied children with bacterial immunotherapy, we found that the mean IFNgamma value in children under immunotherapy for longer than one year was 56.4 pg/ml, whereas in children with no immunotherapy it was 101.75 pg/ml (p = 0.034).

After isolation from a pulp mill wastewater treatment facility, two yeast strains, designated SPT1 and SPT2, were characterized and used in the development of mediated biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) biosensors for wastewater. 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed a one nucleotide difference between the sequence of SPT1 and those of Candida sojae and Candida viswanthii. While SPT2 had the highest overall homology to Pichia norvegensis, at only 73.5%, it is clearly an ascomycete, based on BLAST comparisons and phylogenetic analyses. Neighbor-joining dendrograms indicated that SPT1 clustered with several Candida spp., and that SPT2 clustered with Starmera spp., albeit as a very deep branch.

A series of novel N- and 3alpha-modified piperidine-based analogues of cocaine were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit reuptake of DA, 5-HT, and NE by the DA, 5-HT, and NE transporters. N-Demethylation of trans-(+)-3alpha-piperidine-based ligands leads to improved activity at the SERT and NET and modest changes at the DAT. Replacement of the N-methyl group in trans-(+)-ester 1a with phenylalkyl groups leads to a modest 2.3-fold improvement in activity at the SERT (K(i) &lt; or = 3.27 microM), insignificant changes at the NET, and a 3.5-fold loss in activity at the DAT (K(i) &gt; or = 810 nM); however, such replacement in cis-(-)-ester 4, the more potent isomer of 1a, leads, in general, to a significant decrease in activity at all monoamine transporters (K(i) &gt; 1 microM). Other N-modified ligands, including the ligands with polar groups incorporated in the N-alkyl substituent (3e-g) and ligands lacking the basic nitrogen (3i and 6d), show decreased activity at all monoamine transporters, though ligands 3e-g are similar in potency at the NET to 1a. N-Norester 2a, a possible metabolite of the lead compound 1a, and alcohol 1c, a compound with a 3alpha-substituent that is more stable to metabolism than 1a, were selected for further behavioral tests in animals. Alcohol 1c and ester 2a are similar in potency at the DAT to cocaine, ester 1a, and oxadiazole 1b, and both fully substitute for cocaine and have potency similar to that of cocaine in drug discrimination tests. Like cocaine, 1c increased locomotor activity (LMA) monotonically with time, whereas 2a produces biphasic effects consisting of initial locomotor depression followed by delayed locomotor stimulation. An interesting difference between cocaine, ester 1a, alcohol 1c, and N-norester 2a is that 1c and 2a are significantly longer acting in LMA tests. Although this result was anticipated for alcohol 1c, it is rather surprising for 2a which has an ester function susceptible to hydrolysis, a pathway of in vivo deactivation of cocaine and its ester analogues.

Gastric carcinoma is thought to develop via the actions of inducers and promoters of carcinogenesis. Tryptophan in charred fish or animal meat, ultraviolet rays, and irradiation, which damage genes of normal cells, have long been regarded as inducers of carcinoma, and agents such as alcohol, tobacco, aflatoxin, and nitrosoamine as promoters, with tobacco having both activities. The interaction between these environmental factors, principally diet, and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is important in the genesis of gastric carcinoma. In this report, the histopathological feature of the Hp gastritis-carcinoma sequence is outlined, and the pathological characteristics of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and endoscopically negative reflux disease (ENRD) and the risk factors for lower esophageal carcinoma after Hp eradicated status in particular are discussed regarding aspects of cell cycle-associated factors. We conclude that (1) Infection with Hp increases the risk of gastric cancer in two histological phenotypes (i.e., diffuse undifferentiated type and intestinal differentiated type). Excessive cell replication and interrupting the mucus secretion mechanism may result in a large proportion of cells with genetic abnormalities. (2) Genetic alterations in gastric carcinogenesis may differ from those in colonic carcinogenesis. (3) The degree of GERD in Japanese patients is milder than that in patients from Western countries, although the incidence of GERD increases the status after successful eradication of Hp.

Muscle is a convenient and accessible site for non-viral gene delivery, which can manufacture gene products and provide a long-duration of gene expression. The level of gene expression after administration of naked DNA plasmid or polymer-formulated DNA plasmid containing a reporter gene to muscle via syringe injection, however, is very low. As a result, no significant therapeutic effect can be detected after saline- or polymer-mediated gene delivery into muscle. In 1998, investigators published a striking new approach--electrotransfection--for intramuscular gene delivery (now commonly referred to as electroporation or electroinjection).

Parameters from single-component isotherm models were used in multicomponent isotherm models to predict the aqueous phase sorption of trichloroethylene (TCE) in the presence of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in four zeolites, Tenax, and three natural solids. The Langmuir, the Polanyi-Dubinin, and the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models were used to simulate single-component sorption in zeolites. The Langmuir two-site, the Polanyi-Dubinin two-site, and the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models were used to simulate single-component sorption in Tenax and natural solids. Two-site models have been used previously to model sorption in soils and sediments, and they combine an adsorption component (e.g., Langmuir) with a linear partitioning component. By using parameters from the different single-component isotherm models, the multicomponent Langmuir, the ideal adsorbed solution theory, and the Polanyi theory were each used to predict multicomponent sorption. In general, the ability to predict TCE sorption in the presence of PCE depended more on the choice of the single-component model than the multicomponent model, and better results were obtained when the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm was used for single-component sorption. This suggests that the more mechanistically based Langmuir and Polanyi-type models may not adequately describe the distribution of adsorption sites in some model and natural solids. The Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich model, although empirical, has greater flexibility in characterizing sorbent heterogeneity and results in better multicomponent model predictions.

However, robust data to evaluate the environmental fate of lanthanides are scarce. This article describes the accumulation and elimination of lanthanum (La) by common duckweed (Lemna minor L.). Speciation modeling was performed to assure that solubility products were not exceeded. It also showed that La was predominantly associated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Lanthanum concentrations in plants and medium and the amounts sorbed to glass vessels were quantified by using the radioisotope 140La. The amount of La adsorbed on the glass reached values of 25% of the total La present. A model was formulated to describe La uptake in exponentially growing duckweed in the presence of an adsorptive surface. Growth-induced dilution appeared more efficient in lowering plant La concentrations than actual elimination. An elimination study revealed two compartments, of which the smallest eliminated 50 times faster than the bigger compartment, which eliminated mainly by growth dilution.

The subjects came from three United States (US) plants that manufactured heavy equipment. The follow-up was extended from 1988 to 1998. The welders were not exposed to asbestos (typical of shipyard welders) or to chromium or nickel (present in stainless steel). There were 108 lung cancer deaths among the welders and 128 such deaths among the nonwelders (double the previous number of lung cancer deaths). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung cancer was 1.46 [95% confidence interval (95% CI 1.20-1.76] for the welders and 1.18 (95% CI 0.98-1.40) for the nonwelders, both in comparison with the US general population. Direct comparison between the welders and nonwelders yielded a rate ratio of 1.22 (95% CI 0.93-1.59). Analyses using a 15-year lag time did not differ greatly from those of an unlagged analysis. There were no marked trends for lung cancer risk by duration of exposure or latency. Evidence from cross-sectional data from a sample of the cohort indicated that the welders smoked somewhat more than the US population and more than the nonwelders.

Pastoral care is now provided by a group of willing staff members known to have an interest in student welfare. The group is known as the 'Pastoral Pool' (PP). Students and staff PP members completed similar questionnaires addressing their expectations of the PP and identifying the need for support systems in general. Pastoral Pool activity was investigated using confidential record sheets stating the frequency, duration and content of each PP encounter. Students were aware of the PP and many would consider using it. Staff and students agreed over the functions of the PP. Students frequently expressed concerns over confidentiality within the system. Uptake was low, with only 3% of students approaching the PP and the majority of PP work performed by only two staff members. The content of meetings was often multifactorial and usually on a subject within the PP remit. The PP is beneficial because pastoral care is provided only by dedicated staff members with an interest in student welfare. Membership is small enough to enable staff training and development. However, the system relies on self-referral by students. Rather than preventing problems arising, it therefore provides secondary support to those students insightful enough to identify their problems and motivated enough to seek help.", "answer": "Pastoral Pool", "covered": false}

The aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low-dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.", "answer": "The neurophysiological changes associated with ketamine-induced pain relief were a significant decrease in EEGalpha amplitude, particularly at the right central electrode, which was significantly related to subjective pain relief.", "covered": false}

Exposure to cat allergen is a major risk factor for sensitization and the development of asthma in many parts of the world. The study was designed to examine the levels of cat allergen (Fel d 1) in homes of two German cities and to detennine predictors of Fel d 1 exposure. We collected dust samples from 405 randomly selected homes in Hamburg (n = 201) and Erfurt (n = 204). In each apartment dust samples were taken from living room floor (LR), bedroom floor (BR), and mattress surface (MA) using vacuum sampling and analyzed by two-site monoclonal antibody ELISA. Environmental variables were assessed by questionnaire to obtain information on factors supposed to have an impact on the Fel d 1 levels in house dust. The effects of possible predictors of Fel d 1 were assessed by multiple linear regression models. Fel d 1 was present in 98% of the homes (395/405), ranging from 0.015 to 7.278 microg/g dust (GM 0.486 microg/g). The levels were similar in floors (GM for LR 0.575 microg/g and BR 0.469 microg/g) and in MA (GM 0.424 microg/g). Higher allergen concentrations (&gt; 2 microg/g) were detected in 99% of the homes keeping cats, in 55% of homes that had had a cat during the last year, and in 28% of the homes without a cat. Fel d 1 levels were significantly higher in homes with a cat (628-682-fold, MA, floor) and in homes in which a cat had previously lived (11-12-fold, floor, MA) than in homes that never had a cat. Furthermore, after controlling for possible other confounders, Fel d 1 levels were significantly higher in summer and in homes with low frequency of cleaning and low ventilation rate. It could be confirmed that keeping a cat has the highest impact on Fel d 1 concentration.

The systemic absorption of balsalazide and its metabolites is not required for the therapeutic efficacy of the drug, and has been demonstrated to be limited. Data from well designed trials with a duration of 8 to 12 weeks show that oral balsalazide 6.75 g/day is as effective as (two trials) or more effective than (one trial) oral delayed-release (pH-dependent) mesalazine 2.4 g/day and appears to be as effective as oral sulfasalazine 3 g/day in the treatment of active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. In addition, balsalazide appears to have a faster onset of action than mesalazine. Furthermore, balsalazide was as effective as delayed-release mesalazine (dosages used were 1.2 and 1.5 g/day, where 1.6 g/day is recommended) and oral sulfasalazine 2 g/day (recommended dosage) in the prevention of relapse in ulcerative colitis in remission after 6 to 12 months of treatment; the balsalazide dosage was 3 g/day versus mesalazine and 2 g/day versus sulfasalazine.

All medical practitioners should be able to manage the airway of an unconscious patient. Endotracheal intubation is the most effective method of securing the airway but is a complex skill requiring much practice. Traditionally, endotracheal intubation has been taught on patients, but this is not ideal. We have developed a short course on endotracheal intubation taught in a clinical simulation unit (CSU). This unit has a large range of airway trainers and patient simulators, some of which can be manipulated to make intubation more difficult. Endotracheal intubation is taught in a series of steps in order to avoid cognitive overload. Each step is taught on an airway trainer that has no difficult features. Once this is mastered, more difficult situations are presented which require application of new techniques and/or equipment. In this way, students learn useful schemas to apply clinically. In 1 year, over 100 students and trainees were taught endotracheal intubation in the CSU. The ideal group size was found to be two students and one trainer. It took 75 to 90 minutes for most students to reach a standard where they could be expected to safely perform the technique on a patient. All comments on learning endotracheal intubation in this setting were positive. Many students felt more comfortable learning on a model than on a patient. Learning clinical procedures on simulators is becoming an essential part of medical education. More than one airway trainer may be needed to give students the expertise to perform endotracheal intubation on patients.", "answer": "The advantage of teaching endotracheal intubation in a clinical simulation unit is that it provides a safe, controlled, and progressively challenging learning environment, allowing for the effective mastery of this complex skill without risking patient safety.", "covered": false}

Surfactant and organic solvents have individually been shown useful in assisting the solubilization of hydrophobic organics out of contaminated soil and promoting UV-induced photodecay at a succeeding treatment process. A newly proposed process is to use the mixtures of surfactant and solvents together in achieving better performance. This study was to explore some basic variables and conditions that may be useful in optimizing the performance of surfactant/solvent-aided UV systems through the selection of surfactant micelles, the adjustment of the reaction pH levels, and the addition of photosensitizer and hydrogen sources. A PCB monomer 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl (DCB) was used as the target compound for this study; about 1.3 to 2.3 times greater DCB photodecay rate enhancements were observed by using surfactant/acetone or surfactant/triethylamine (TEA) combinations at their optimal conditions. Overdose of these additives (acetone and TEA) will result in retardation of the reactions.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_166_0", "question": "How is the planning volume for adjuvant brachytherapy treatment in soft-tissue sarcoma currently determined?", "doc_chunk": "Automated planning volume definition in soft-tissue sarcoma adjuvant brachytherapy. In current practice, the planning volume for adjuvant brachytherapy treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma is either not determined a priori (in this case, seed locations are selected based on isodose curves conforming to a visual estimate of the planning volume), or it is derived via a tedious manual process. In either case, the process is subjective and time consuming, and is highly dependent on the human planner. The focus of the work described herein involves the development of an automated contouring algorithm to outline the planning volume. Such an automatic procedure will save time and provide a consistent and objective method for determining planning volumes. In addition, a definitive representation of the planning volume will allow for sophisticated brachytherapy treatment planning approaches to be applied when designing treatment plans, so as to maximize local tumour control and minimize normal tissue complications. An automated tumour volume contouring algorithm is developed utilizing computational geometry and numerical interpolation techniques in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method. The target volume is defined to be the slab of tissue r cm perpendicularly away from the curvilinear plane defined by the mesh of catheters. We assume that if adjacent catheters are over 2r cm apart, the tissue between the two catheters is part of the tumour bed. Input data consist of the digitized coordinates of the catheter positions in each of several cross-sectional slices of the tumour bed, and the estimated distance r from the catheters to the tumour surface. Mathematically, one can view the planning volume as the volume enclosed within a minimal smoothly-connected surface which contains a set of circles, each circle centred at a given catheter position in a given cross-sectional slice. The algorithm performs local interpolation on consecutive triplets of circles. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated based on its performance on a collection of soft-tissue sarcoma tumour beds within various anatomical structures. For each of 15 patient cases considered, the algorithm takes approximately 2 min to generate the planning volume. Although the tumour shapes are rather different, the algorithm consistently generates planning volumes that visually demonstrate smooth curves compactly encapsulating the circles. This general-purpose contouring algorithm works well whether the catheters are all close together, spread far apart in the plane or arranged in a convoluted way. The automatic contouring algorithm significantly reduces labour time and provides a consistent and objective method for determining planning volumes for soft-tissue sarcoma. Further studies are needed to validate the significance of the resulting planning volumes in designing treatment plans and the role that sophisticated brachytherapy treatment planning optimization may have in producing good plans.", "answer": "The planning volume for adjuvant brachytherapy treatment in soft-tissue sarcoma is currently determined either by not being predefined and using seed locations based on isodose curves conforming to a visual estimate, or through a tedious manual process.", "covered": false}

Seventy asymptomatic patients were studied up to 12 days after first Q wave anterior myocardial infarction and again after 6 months. Each patient had LV volume measured by all three techniques within 24 hours of each other on each occasion. LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume index (LVESVI and LVEDVI) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured using the modified Simpson formula (echo), a counts-based method (RNV), and a multislice area summation method (MRI). Radionuclide volumes were measured both with and without correction for attenuation of isotope. Echocardiography overestimated LV volume compared with MRI. Mean (SD) differences (echo-MRI) were: LVEDVI + 10.6 ml/m2 (16.8), LVESVI + 13.7 ml/m2 (12.9), LVEF -8.5% (11.2). RNV underestimated both volume and ejection fraction compared with MRI.

Sudden unexpected deaths have been reported with antipsychotic use since the early 1960s. In some cases the antipsychotic may be unrelated to death, but in others it appears to be a causal factor. Antipsychotics can cause sudden death by several mechanisms, but particular interest has centred on torsade de pointes (TdP), a polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia that can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. The QTc interval is a heart rate-corrected value that represents the time between the onset of electrical depolarisation of the ventricles and the end of repolarisation. Prolongation of the QTc interval is a surrogate marker for the ability of a drug to cause TdP. In individual patients an absolute QTc interval of &gt;500 msec or an increase of 60 msec from baseline is regarded as indicating an increased risk of TdP. However, TdP can occur with lower QTc values or changes. Concern about a relationship between QTc prolongation, TdP and sudden death applies to a wide range of drugs and has led to the withdrawal or restricted labelling of several. Among antipsychotics available in the UK, sertindole was voluntarily suspended, droperidol was withdrawn, and restricted labelling introduced for thioridazine and pimozide. The degree of QTc prolongation is dose dependent and varies between antipsychotics reflecting their different capacity to block cardiac ion channels. Significant prolongation is not a class effect. Among currently available agents, thioridazine and ziprasidone are associated with the greatest QTc prolongation. Virtually all drugs known to cause TdP block the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(kr)). Arrhythmias are more likely to occur if drug-induced QTc prolongation coexists with other risk factors, such as individual susceptibility, presence of congenital long QT syndromes, heart failure, bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, overdose of a QTc prolonging drug, female sex, restraint, old age, hepatic or renal impairment, and slow metaboliser status. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions can also increase the risk of arrhythmias. Further research is needed to quantify the risk of sudden death with antipsychotics. The risk should be viewed in the context of the overall risks and benefits of antipsychotic treatment. It seems prudent, where possible, to select antipsychotics that are not associated with marked QTc prolongation. If use of a QTc-prolonging drug is warranted, then measures to reduce the risk should be adopted.", "answer": "Risk factors that can increase the likelihood of arrhythmias when drug-induced QTc prolongation is present include individual susceptibility, congenital long QT syndromes, heart failure, bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, overdose of a QTc prolonging drug, female sex, restraint, old age, hepatic or renal impairment, slow metaboliser status, and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions.", "covered": false}

A polymorphism (C825T) in the gene encoding the G protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) has recently been associated with hypertension and obesity in several populations. The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between this polymorphism and insulin sensitivity, an hypothesised unifying factor for hypertension and obesity. One hundred thirty unrelated patients with essential hypertension, 70 female and 60 male, aged 58 +/- 1 years with systolic blood pressure of 173 +/- 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 105 +/- 1 mm Hg, were genotyped for the GNB3 polymorphism by PCR and restriction digestion with BseDI, and classified in two groups according to the genotypes CC and CT + TT. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in patients with the T allele as compared with patients without the T allele (29.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 26.7 +/- 0.6 kg/m2, p&lt;0.001). On the contrary, there were no differences in the level of systolic or diastolic blood pressure among the genotypes. Insulin sensitivity was measured in a subgroup of 35 patients by means of an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. In this subgroup, patients with the T allele displayed lower insulin sensitivity index (1.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/min, p = 0.022), higher fasting serum insulin (121 +/- 16 vs. 77 +/- 11 pmol/L, p = 0.032), higher serum glucose 120 min after 75 g load (9.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, p = 0.038), and higher glycosilated haemoglobin (5.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.2%; p = 0.042) as compared with patients without the T allele. A regression analysis showed that the association between the T allele and insulin sensitivity was independent of BMI (beta coefficient -0.386, p = 0.022).

Allergic contact dermatitis represents the classic presentation of a T cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity response to exogenous agents. The initial step in the development of allergic contact dermatitis, as in nickel allergy, is hapten binding to a skin carrier protein. A hapten by itself is not immunogenic but becomes so after binding to a skin protein carrier. The hapten protein complex forms through covalent bonds between the hapten and amino acid side chains of target proteins within the skin. [8] The complex ultimately produces the sensitization of T cells. Sensitized T cells encountering the antigen at any time later will then lead to the release of cytokines, which in turn leads to macrophage activation and produces the immune response.

Docetaxel (Taxotere) has extended the armamentarium of agents with significant activity in the treatment of ovarian cancer. As a single agent in advanced ovarian cancer patients previously treated with a platinum agent, docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks yields a 30% overall response rate and a 6-month duration of response. In vitro data demonstrate a lack of complete cross-resistance between docetaxel and paclitaxel. As a result, antitumor activity has also been demonstrated in patients refractory to a paclitaxel-containing regimen. In both platinum- and paclitaxel-pretreated patients, the highest response rates were obtained in patients with the longest interval of time since receipt of prior chemotherapy. Docetaxel has been successfully combined with the platinum salts for the first-line treatment of ovarian cancer patients. In combination with cisplatin, response rates of 69% were reported. In an effort to minimize hematologic toxicities and asthenia associated with the cisplatin/docetaxel combination, investigators have substituted carboplatin (Paraplatin) for cisplatin. Several phase II studies and the Scottish Randomized Trial in Ovarian Cancer (SCOTROC), a large phase III randomized trial, of the docetaxel/ carboplatin combination have been completed. The most frequent toxicity noted is neutropenia, which is generally of brief duration, predictable, and manageable. The docetaxel/carboplatin combination has a notably low rate of neurotoxicity.

Over the last few decades, there have been considerable improvements in the outcome of stroke patients both as regards mortality and disability. At least some of these improvements can be attributed to better organization of services and improved rehabilitation. Many patients, however, remain severely disabled and we will need to develop new strategies in which the focus will be on reversing impairments rather than simply helping patients to adapt to unaltered impairments. For this to happen, neurological rehabilitation research will have to develop therapies that have a clearly defined rationale and are rooted in neurosciences, are clinically described, are addressed to a well-characterized target population and are evaluated using appropriate outcome measures. Few studies at present meet all these criteria. The recent revolution in our understanding of the nervous system as being soft-wired, of the potential for recovery through reorganization and of the central role of afferent information associated with normal activity is ground for optimism and indicates the direction in which future therapies should be sought. The paper considers some approaches to providing appropriate afferent information, including inputs such as that from electrotherapy, novel approaches to assisted activity and constraint-induced therapy.

Recent American Heart Association guidelines suggest amiodarone as an antiarrhythmic in refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). The authors sought to assess the impact of amiodarone use on outcomes and cost associated with this practice in a rural emergency medical services (EMS) state. Statewide EMS records were reviewed for the calendar year 1999. Data reviewed included prehospital diagnosis, medications given by prehospital providers to patients with cardiac arrest, and procedures performed, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Cost-benefit analysis assumed the cost of amiodarone treatment to be $137.65 per patient encounter. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT) analysis utilized resuscitation rates published in the ARREST and ALIVE trials. During the study period, EMS providers diagnosed 2,189 patients as having cardiac arrest. Five hundred thirty-five (24.4%) cardiac arrest patients were defibrillated. One hundred sixty patients (7.3%), including 15 who did not receive defibrillation, were given lidocaine during resuscitation efforts. The annual cost increase from current practice for a statewide amiodarone VF/VT protocol was $21,822.40 (10,572.87%). The initial cost to stock EMS vehicles for this protocol would be $50,115.52. The cost-benefit analysis yielded a potential for one additional patient survival to hospital discharge in Maine per 3.125 years of system-wide practice at a cost of $68,840.00.

L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLME) prevents GVHD in several animal models by depleting dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI)-expressing cytotoxic cellular subsets. However, clinical application has been hampered by difficulties in stem cell engraftment following treatment of donor bone marrow inocula with LLME at the concentrations necessary to purge DPPI-expressing T-cells. Noting that T-cells can mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses via both perforin (usually co-expressed in cytotoxic granules with DPPI) and Fas ligand pathways in a murine model, we hypothesized that LLME might be useful for treatment of delayed DLIs for potential GVL activity with a decreased risk of GVHD induction. In regard to the clinical setting, the ex vivo use of LLME for this purpose would circumvent any toxicity issues for donor stem cells, because by that time patients would have already achieved successful engraftment.

A DLI of LLME-treated donor splenocytes, from B6 mice presensitized to recipient alloantigens, was administered in varying doses 14 days post-marrow transplantation, and the potential for both GVHD and GVL activity was assessed. All mice that received any dose of LLME-treated DLI survived indefinitely, without evidence of cachexia nor B-cell hypoplasia, in contrast to the severe and lethal GVHD induced by mock-treated DLI. Histological analysis largely correlated with the symptomatic findings and revealed no GVHD-like lesions in the spleens of LLME-treated DLI recipients, although some mice displayed various degrees of hepatic mononuclear infiltration. Most notably, mice given LLME-treated DLI also experienced DLI dose-dependent increases in survival against the challenge with the MMD2-8 leukemia.

Controlled delivery of neurotrophic proteins to a target tissue by biodegradable polymer microspheres has been explored widely for its potential applications in the treatment of various disorders in the nervous system. We investigated in this study the potential of polyphosphoester microspheres as carriers for the sustained release of nerve growth factor (NGF), a water-soluble neurotrophic protein. Two polyphosphoesters (PPEs), P(BHET-EOP/TC) and P(DAPG-EOP), as well as poly(lactide/glycolic acid) (PLGA), were used to fabricate microspheres by a W/O/W emulsion and solvent evaporation/extraction method. With bovine serum albumin as a model protein to optimize processing parameters. P(DAPG-EOP) microspheres exhibited a lower burst effect but similar protein entrapment levels and efficiencies when compared with those made of PLGA. Bioactive NGF could be released for at least 10 weeks from the P(DAPG-EOP) microspheres, as confirmed by a neurite outgrowth assay of the PC12 cells. These NGF containing microspheres were incorporated into the nerve guide conduits that were implanted to bridge a 10 mm gap in a rat sciatic nerve model. Two weeks after implantation, immunostaining with an antibody against the neurofilament protein confirmed the presence of axons at the distal end of regenerated cables within the NGF microsphere-loaded conduits.

An 1-year study of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill found that spill residues on the oiled shorelines rapidly lost toxicity through weathering. After 1990, toxicity of sediments remained at only a few heavily oiled, isolated locations in Prince William Sound (AK, USA), as measured by a standard amphipod bioassay using Rhepoxynius abronius. Data from 648 sediment samples taken during the 1990 to 1993 period were statistically analyzed to determine the relationship between the total concentration of 39 parent and methyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (defined as total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [TPAH]) and amphipod mortality and the effect of oil weathering on toxicity. A logistic regression model yielded estimates of the lower threshold, LC10 (lethal concentration to 10% of the population), and LC50 (median lethal concentration) values of 2,600, 4,100, and 10,750 ng/g TPAH (dry wt), respectively. Estimates of the threshold and LC50 values in this field study relate well to corresponding sediment quality guideline (SQG) values reported in the literature. For sediment TPAH concentrations &gt;2,600 ng/g, samples with high mortality values (&gt;90%) had relatively high fractions of naphthalenes and those with low mortality (&lt;20%) had relatively high fractions of chrysenes. By 1999, the median sediment TPAH concentration of 117 ng/g for the post-1989 worst-case sites studied were well below the 2,600 ng/g toxicity threshold value, confirming the lack of potential for long-term toxic effects. Analysis of biological community structure parameters for sediment samples taken concurrently found that species richness and Shannon diversity decreased with increasing TPAH above the 2,600 ng/g threshold, demonstrating a correspondence between sediment bioassay results and biological community effects in the field. The low probability of exposure to toxic concentrations of weathered spill residues at the worst-case sites sampled in this study is consistent with the rapid overall recovery of shoreline biota observed in 1990 to 1991.", "answer": "The sediment TPAH concentration levels in Prince William Sound were well below the toxicity threshold value established in the study.", "covered": false}

Participants later completed a recognition test in which some of the sentences were old, some novel, and some analogical inferences that were not seen before. Participants who read the description of a source analog erroneously recognized analogical inferences as being in the target description. The effect occurred with different delays between study and test and with an unfamiliar target domain. It also occurred when source and target shared few superficial features.

Mechanisms and relevance of idiosyncratic drug reactions. In adverse drug reactions, effects accounted for by the pharmacological profile of the drug may be distinguished from sometimes bizarre, unpredictable events (\"idiosyncrasies\"). In the majority of cases, the latter are due to reactive intermediates formed by members of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These products are usually formed at very low quantities. However, genetic disposition (e.g. by enhanced expression of the catalyzing enzyme or failure of protective factors such as glutathione) or certain external conditions (for example comedication of inducers of drug metabolism) may lead to toxic intermediates being available at relevant quantities. Once generated, these metabolites will react with macromolecules and finally cause cell necrosis. Necrosis may result from direct damage to functions essential to the cell or be secondary to harmful immune reactions activated by recognition of the new structures as neoantigens. As the principal site of drug metabolism, the liver is most frequently affected by idiosyncratic reactions, which often enough are recognized only after large numbers of patients have been treated. The idiosyncratic potential of a drug relates to its chemical structure rather than its pharmacological mechanism. Risks are evident if biotransformation yields products with chemical substructures such as quinones, phenoles, acyl halides, aromatic and hydroxyl amines. There are numerous cases of precursor drugs with idiosyncratic potential that have been replaced or marginalized by agents with more favorable chemical properties. Examples include beta 1-preferential beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (toxic precursor: practolol) and the choline esterase inhibitors used in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the latter group, tacrine (CAS 321-64-2) gives rise to high liver enzyme levels in about 30% of the patients, an effect not shared with more recent, chemically different entities. A similar case can be made for the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (CAS 97322-87-7) (marketed, now withdrawn in the USA) and its successors rosiglitazone (CAS 122320-73-4) and pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8). Due to its different chemical structure, only troglitazone can be transformed into a reactive quinone metabolite, a process that may be accelerated by the drug inducing its own metabolism. In agreement with this view, there is no evidence of specific hepatic toxicity with the two successor drugs. Ongoing progress in molecular toxicology may aid in minimizing idiosyncratic hazards already at early stages of drug development.", "answer": "The liver is the most frequently affected organ by idiosyncratic drug reactions because it is the principal site of drug metabolism.", "covered": false}

Sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) was first launched in the US in 1997 as an aid to smoking cessation and has since been launched in many other countries. Adverse events associated with the use of bupropion SR at the recommended dosage of 150mg twice daily in clinical trials most commonly included insomnia, headache, dry mouth, nausea and anxiety; insomnia and anxiety are also recognised as symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Only insomnia and dry mouth occurred significantly more frequently with bupropion SR than with placebo. Relative to placebo, no significant changes in mean values for heart rate, blood pressure or routine laboratory parameters have been reported in smokers using bupropion SR alone in clinical trials. When bupropion SR was compared with a nicotine transdermal patch in a clinical trial, insomnia predominated in the bupropion SR group, while dream abnormalities were more common in smokers using the nicotine patch. Bupropion SR and the nicotine transdermal patch in combination can be used safely (with appropriate monitoring) as an aid to smoking cessation. Infrequent but clinically important adverse reactions to bupropion SR include seizures and hypersensitivity reactions: in controlled clinical trials of bupropion SR (300 mg/day), where smokers were carefully screened for risk factors for seizure, the incidence of both seizures and severe hypersensitivity reactions was approximately 0.1% for each event. In order to avoid a risk of seizure of greater than 0.1%, smokers should be screened for predisposing risk factors and adhere to the manufacturer's dosage recommendations (maximum daily dose of 300mg). Thus, bupropion SR is generally well tolerated, as seen by the low discontinuation rate due to an adverse event in clinical trials (6 to 12%).

Ex vivo gene transfer with viral and non-viral vectors is frequently used to obtain expression of the tumor antigens and thereby to formulate the therapeutic vaccines. Efficacy of the approaches is greatly enhanced if dendritic cells are transfected with a number of genes which encode immunostimulating factors. In some cases, such as with IL-12, IL-7 and CD40L genes, injection inside experimental malignancies of thus transfected dendritic cells induces complete tumor regression in several models. In this case tumor antigens are captured by dendritic cells by still unclear mechanisms and transported to lymphoid organs where productive antigen presentation to T-cells takes place.

Malaysia enjoys a comprehensive range of health services, the government being committed to the principles of universal access to high quality health care, which the Ministry of Health provides through a wide variety of nation wide network of clinics and hospitals. One of the major problems is the availability of comprehensiveness and quality of health care in remote health centres. When patients are transferred from the health centres to the hospitals for further treatment, this not only incurs inconvenience to the patients and their family but also increases the cost to the health care system. Teleprimary care is one of the tools to overcome this problem. The doctors in the remote clinics are able to discuss the problem cases through teleconsultation with the doctors and specialist in the hospitals using an audiovisual system to provide better care in the health centers without transferring the patients to the hospitals. Only the essential and needy patients are referred to the hospitals. This has not only reduced the number of patients referred to the hospitals but it has reduced the cost to the health care system.

The prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders that have attracted great interest because of the possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CTD) in humans. Possible transmission of these diseases has been linked to a single protein termed the prion protein. This protein is an abnormal isoform of a normal synaptic glycoprotein. The majority of prion diseases does not appear to be caused by transmission of an infectious agent but occur spontaneously with no known cause. The strongest supporting evidence that the prion protein is the causative agent in prion disease comes from specific inheritable forms of prion disease which are linked to single point mutations in the prion protein gene. Paradoxically, these point mutations, although autosomal dominant with 100% penetrance do not lead to disease until late in life.

An improved dynamic coupled column liquid chromatographic (DCCLC) technique for determining water solubility data of hydrophobic compounds is presented. The technique is based on pumping water through a thermostated generator column in order to generate emulsion-free, saturated aqueous solutions of the compound under study. Through a switching valve system the solute in the aqueous solution is extracted and concentrated by an on-line solid-phase extraction process and subsequently eluted and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (fluorescence detection coupled to photodiode array detection). The improvements carried out to the original DCCLC technique have given rise to savings in time for the experimental work and increased sensitivity during the detection and quantification stage. Applicability of the method for studying highly hydrophobic substances is demonstrated by determining water solubility of anthracene and pyrene in the temperature range of 8.9-49.9 and 8.5-32.2 degrees C, respectively.

L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLME) prevents GVHD in several animal models by depleting dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI)-expressing cytotoxic cellular subsets. However, clinical application has been hampered by difficulties in stem cell engraftment following treatment of donor bone marrow inocula with LLME at the concentrations necessary to purge DPPI-expressing T-cells. Noting that T-cells can mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses via both perforin (usually co-expressed in cytotoxic granules with DPPI) and Fas ligand pathways in a murine model, we hypothesized that LLME might be useful for treatment of delayed DLIs for potential GVL activity with a decreased risk of GVHD induction. In regard to the clinical setting, the ex vivo use of LLME for this purpose would circumvent any toxicity issues for donor stem cells, because by that time patients would have already achieved successful engraftment. For our preclinical studies, we used the haploidentical C57BL/6 (B6) (H2b) --&gt; ((B6 x DBA/2)F1 (H(2b/d)) murine model with lethally irradiated hosts that had received transplants of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells and were challenged with the MMD2-8 myeloid leukemia line (H2d) of DBA/2 origin. A DLI of LLME-treated donor splenocytes, from B6 mice presensitized to recipient alloantigens, was administered in varying doses 14 days post-marrow transplantation, and the potential for both GVHD and GVL activity was assessed. All mice that received any dose of LLME-treated DLI survived indefinitely, without evidence of cachexia nor B-cell hypoplasia, in contrast to the severe and lethal GVHD induced by mock-treated DLI. Histological analysis largely correlated with the symptomatic findings and revealed no GVHD-like lesions in the spleens of LLME-treated DLI recipients, although some mice displayed various degrees of hepatic mononuclear infiltration. Most notably, mice given LLME-treated DLI also experienced DLI dose-dependent increases in survival against the challenge with the MMD2-8 leukemia. LLME-treated splenocytes remained immunocompetent, as these cells could proliferate in response to mitogens and to restimulation with ovalbumin when used as a recall antigen.

Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) complicating the acute phase of myocardial infarction (AMI) is a quite rare event but with short-term unfavorable prognosis. The clinical characteristics as well as the therapeutic implications have not yet been well defined. This paper attempts to prove that VT may be considered a marker of inadequate myocardial perfusion after thrombolysis. To assess the clinic-electroangiographic characteristics and prognosis of patients with VT occurring within the first 4 days of an AMI, a case-control study was carried out in 23 patients from a total of 1,100 patients (1.9%) hospitalized with AMI between March 1993 and July 1997. These patients were compared with a control group of 131 patients hospitalized consecutively. A statistical analysis was made using the chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression. There were no differences among groups with regard to age, gender, and area of necrosis. Average time for the onset of VT was 26 h (range 0-92 h). Sixteen patients underwent coronary angiography: 4 patients had left main coronary artery disease, 2 had single-vessel disease, 8 had lesions in two vessels, and 2 had triple-vessel disease. Univariate analysis showed that patients with VT had a higher incidence of creatine phosphokinase (CPK)-MB peak &gt; 300 UI/l (61 vs. 30%; p&lt;0.001), more frequent occurrence of previous AMI (48 vs. 17%; p&lt;0.001), and acute intraventricular conduction disorders (26 vs. 4%; p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, these patients suffered ischemia previous to VT more frequently (65 vs. 11%; p&lt;0.0001), and had a greater mortality rate than that in the control group (35 vs. 4%; p&lt;0.0001). In the multivariant analysis, the variables related to the occurrence of VT were CPK-MB peak &gt; 300 IU/l (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.6-21), acute intraventricular conduction disorders (OR 9.02; 95% CI 1.7-48), and ischemia immediately prior to VT (odds ratio [OR] 19.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-73). Ventricular tachycardia may be considered a marker of inadequate myocardial perfusion after thrombolysis; therefore, a more aggressive revascularization treatment in these patients would be advisable.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease that afflicts up to 1 in 2,500 people in the western world. Since 1989, when mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene were identified as responsible for the disease, intense effort has been applied to the development of replacement gene therapy strategies to cure CF. Problems with basic gene delivery techniques along with limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of CF have hindered progress so far. However, recent insights into the expression patterns and functions of CFTR in developing and adult lungs are now advancing our understanding of this disease. It is becoming apparent that progress in gene delivery to cure CF may be best served by identification of a target cell(s) around which gene transfer strategies can be specifically tailored to most closely reproduce the effects of normal CFTR expression. In fact, accurate restoration of endogenous expression patterns may be crucial, not only for disease reversal, but also to avoid potentially deleterious effects of inappropriate expression. This approach is in turn confounded however, by ill-defined stem and progenitor cell pathways within the lung epithelium. Nonetheless, studies to date suggest that these pathways are relatively plastic and may respond differently during homeostasis compared with repair following injury. It may therefore be feasible to target the lung epithelium in a non-cell specific manner and allow endogenous differentiation pathways to subsequently establish correct CFTR distribution patterns. In this review, emerging information on CFTR expression and function in developing and adult lungs is discussed in the context of putative stem cell populations and their potential for current gene delivery approaches.", "answer": "CFTR gene.", "covered": false}

A series of novel N- and 3alpha-modified piperidine-based analogues of cocaine were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit reuptake of DA, 5-HT, and NE by the DA, 5-HT, and NE transporters. N-Demethylation of trans-(+)-3alpha-piperidine-based ligands leads to improved activity at the SERT and NET and modest changes at the DAT. Replacement of the N-methyl group in trans-(+)-ester 1a with phenylalkyl groups leads to a modest 2.3-fold improvement in activity at the SERT (K(i) &lt; or = 3.27 microM), insignificant changes at the NET, and a 3.5-fold loss in activity at the DAT (K(i) &gt; or = 810 nM); however, such replacement in cis-(-)-ester 4, the more potent isomer of 1a, leads, in general, to a significant decrease in activity at all monoamine transporters (K(i) &gt; 1 microM). Other N-modified ligands, including the ligands with polar groups incorporated in the N-alkyl substituent (3e-g) and ligands lacking the basic nitrogen (3i and 6d), show decreased activity at all monoamine transporters, though ligands 3e-g are similar in potency at the NET to 1a. N-Norester 2a, a possible metabolite of the lead compound 1a, and alcohol 1c, a compound with a 3alpha-substituent that is more stable to metabolism than 1a, were selected for further behavioral tests in animals. Alcohol 1c and ester 2a are similar in potency at the DAT to cocaine, ester 1a, and oxadiazole 1b, and both fully substitute for cocaine and have potency similar to that of cocaine in drug discrimination tests. Like cocaine, 1c increased locomotor activity (LMA) monotonically with time, whereas 2a produces biphasic effects consisting of initial locomotor depression followed by delayed locomotor stimulation. An interesting difference between cocaine, ester 1a, alcohol 1c, and N-norester 2a is that 1c and 2a are significantly longer acting in LMA tests. Although this result was anticipated for alcohol 1c, it is rather surprising for 2a which has an ester function susceptible to hydrolysis, a pathway of in vivo deactivation of cocaine and its ester analogues.

(+/-)-UB-165 (1) is a potent neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligand, which displays functional selectivity between nAChR subtypes. Using UB-165 as a lead structure, two classes of racemic ligands were synthesized and assessed in binding assays for three major nAChR subtypes (alpha4beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha7). The first class of compounds comprises the three pyridine isomers 4-6, corresponding to the 3-, 2-, and 4-substituted pyridine isomers, respectively. Deschloro UB-165 (4) displayed a 2-3-fold decrease in affinity at alpha4beta2 and alpha3beta4 nAChR subtypes, as compared with (+/-)-UB-165, while at the alpha7 subtype a 31-fold increase in affinity was observed. At each of the nAChR subtypes, high affinity binding was dependent on the presence of a 3-substituted pyridine, and the other isomers, 5 and 6, resulted in marked decreases in binding affinities. The second class of compounds is based on replacing the pyridyl unit of 1 with a diazine moiety, giving pyridazine (7), pyrimidine (8), and pyrazine (9), which retain the \"3-pyridyl\" substructure. Modest reductions in binding affinity were observed for all of the diazine ligands at all nAChR subtypes, with the exception of 7, which retained potency comparable to that of 4 in binding to alpha7 nAChR.

These findings suggest that DLCs have acted as selective agents, allowing the survival of only the most tolerant individuals, forming DLC-adapted populations. We hypothesized that DLC-tolerant mummichog populations would reside where local conditions are toxic to sensitive individuals, and that toxic environmental conditions could be predicted based on responses of sensitive early life stages to laboratory exposures of DLCs.

Selective MAOIs such as selegiline might be less prone to this effect, but the drug's selectivity diminishes at higher doses. Nonetheless, patients still need to be counseled to avoid these tyramine-rich foods.

Over the past decade, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have been managed with preoperative chemoradiation. Patients achieving a complete clinical response to preoperative chemoradiation have had better pelvic tumor control, sphincterpreservation, and overall survival than those with gross residual disease. Some patients achieving a complete clinical response have even had rectal-preserving surgery (full-thickness local excision). These results emphasize the importance of maximizing tumor response. Further improvement in response and survival could be achieved by using novel chemotherapeutic agents or through tumor-selective molecular targeting strategies that enhance the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) is a novel chemotherapy agent being evaluated clinically as a radiosensitizing agent in rectal cancer. Inhibition of several molecular targets-such as epidermal growth factor receptor, ras oncogene activation, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, and neoangiogenesis-appears to be tumor-selective in preclinical models. COX-2 expression has been shown to enhance cytotoxic therapy in preclinical models. In vitro and in vivo studies show that selective COX-2 inhibition enhances the effects of radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. COX-2 is also markedly upregulated in human colorectal cancer and appears to be associated with adverse patient prognosis.

In the TAX 317 trial, 204 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (49 received 100 mg/m2 and 55 received 75 mg/m2) or best supportive care (100 patients). Median survival was 7.5 months with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75) vs 4.6 months for best supportive care (P = .010); and 1-year survival was 37% for D75 vs 11% for best supportive care (P = .010). Quality-of-life analysis also showed statistically significant improvement in disease-related symptoms with docetaxel vs best supportive care. In the TAX 320 study, 373 patients were randomized to receive docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 (D100), docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75), or a control arm of either vinorelbine (Navelbine) or ifosfamide (Ifex) (V/I).

The temporal changes and spatial variability of phosphorus and nitrogen losses and concentrations in Finland during the period 1981-1997 were studied in 15 small agricultural and forested catchments. In addition, four coastal river basins with high agricultural land use located in southern Finland were included in the study in order to assess the representativeness of agricultural loss estimates from small agricultural catchments. The mean annual loss specific for agricultural land was estimated to be on average 110 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total phosphorus and 1500 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total nitrogen. The results from small agricultural catchments were in agreement with the corresponding loss estimates from rivers, with an average of 137 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total phosphorus and 1800 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total nitrogen. The results from the studied agricultural catchments and rivers during the period 1981-1997 suggest that weather-driven fluctuation in discharge was usually the main reason for changes in nutrient losses, and little or no impact of changes in agricultural production or management practises can be observed.

Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed a standard or a Zn-deficient diet for 4 weeks, we examined whether Zn deficiency affects systemic blood pressure (BP) levels in a genetically hypertensive state through a fall in the activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet had a progressive increase in systolic BP during the dietary conditioning. Consequently, SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet exhibited significantly increased levels of systolic BP by 2 weeks after the start of dietary treatment when compared with SHR fed a standard diet. Similarly, levels of basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) observed at the end of dietary treatment were SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet &gt; SHR fed a standard diet. Administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME, caused an increase in MAP levels in the two groups of rats, demonstrating the involvement of the vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), in the regulation of systemic BP in a genetically hypertensive state. The expression of endothelial (e) NOS mRNA and protein in the thoracic aorta paralleled basal MAP levels in the two groups of rats, suggesting the counter-regulation of eNOS against the developed hypertensive state in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet. On the other hand, administration of the superoxide scavenger, tempol (a SOD mimetic compound), led to a decrease in MAP levels in the two groups of rats, indicating the participation of the oxygen free radical, superoxide, in an increase in systemic BP in a genetically hypertensive state. As reported recently, the mechanism involved is due likely to a decrease in the action of the vasodilator, NO, based on the formation of peroxynitrite coming from the non-enzymatic reaction of superoxide and NO. In addition, tempol treatment completely restored MAP levels in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet to levels comparable to those observed in SHR fed a standard diet, indicating that a further increase in systemic BP levels seen in SHR fed a Zn-deficient vs. a standard diet is presumably brought by a reduction in the action of the vasodilator, NO, resulting from an increase in the action of superoxide. The activity of the superoxide scavenger, Cu/Zn-SOD, in the thoracic aorta was significantly decreased in SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet relative to SHR fed a standard diet. It appears that a decrease in the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD observed in the thoracic aorta of SHR fed a Zn-deficient diet at least in part plays a role in an increase in the action of superoxide in this model. Thus, Zn deficiency may be a factor to develop genetic hypertension presumably through the oxidative stress caused by superoxide.", "answer": "Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase regulates blood pressure in genetically hypertensive rats by modulating superoxide levels, which affects the action of nitric oxide, a key vasodilator.", "covered": false}

{"id": "article-30531_8_1", "question": "What strategies are available to manage bleeding in trauma patients?", "doc_chunk": "Trauma Assessment -- Technique or Treatment -- Circulation. The assessment of circulation focuses on hemorrhage control and maintaining adequate perfusion. Hemorrhage has been identified as the most common cause of preventable death in trauma victims. [1] Start by visually evaluating the patient looking for external hemorrhage or signs of shock like pallor. Palpate the patient's carotid and femoral pulses while assessing if the skin is cold and diaphoretic. The patient's mentation can also offer clues to how well they are perfusing their vital organs, but care should be taken to rely on this in patients with a possible head injury. In the presence of external bleeding, control should be attempted by direct pressure. In the case of arterial bleed from an extremity, a tourniquet can be applied. If the patient does not have palpable central pulses, further investigation and intervention are needed. The 5 locations to look for major hemorrhage include the thorax, peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal cavity, pelvic or long bone fractures, and externally. The focused assessment using sonography in trauma (FAST) exam may be used to assess for intra-abdominal hemorrhage. In patients with shock, isotonic intravenous fluids can be initially administered, but blood products are preferred in a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio of red blood cells to plasma to platelets for patients with ongoing fluid requirements and concerns for hemorrhage. [5] [6] Be aware that the trauma victim may be on anticoagulation, and this may need to be reversed. [7] Shock may also be caused by tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or spinal cord injury. The FAST exam and extended FAST exam (includes pulmonary evaluation) also aid in the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade and pneumothorax. Thoracotomy may be performed if an intrathoracic cause of shock is suspected. Establishing adequate IV access in trauma patients is also of critical importance. Two large-bore peripheral IVs, or functioning intraosseous access, should be established early in the evaluation period. Cardiac monitoring should also be established as soon as feasible.", "answer": "Direct pressure, tourniquet application, FAST exam, administration of blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio, reversal of anticoagulation, and establishing vascular access are interventions to control hemorrhage in trauma patients.", "covered": true}

Orthotopic liver transplantation is a life saving and life enhancing procedure. The development of immunosuppressive drugs has contributed to the high rate of success in terms of both patient and graft survival. However, the considerable adverse effects of these therapies are affecting long-term outcomes of transplant recipients. Complications related to immunosuppression are responsible for the majority of deaths in patients surviving more than 1 year. Therefore, the search for an optimal immunosuppressive regimen has become of paramount importance. The liver has proved to be an 'immunologically privileged' organ, capable in several animal models to be accepted as an allograft without any intervention on the immune system of the recipient. In some human liver allografts acceptance of the new organ is recognised after withdrawal of immunosuppressants, but prior identification of such individuals is not yet possible, thus negating this management option. Graft-recipient interaction is peculiar in liver transplantation: acute cellular rejection does not always need to be treated, and if it is not severe, appears to be associated with a better survival of both patient and graft. In the last decade there has been an evolution of immunosuppressive protocols, driven by empirical observation and a deeper understanding of immunological events after transplant. However, most modifications have been made because of the necessity to reduce long-term drug related morbidity and mortality. Withdrawal of corticosteroids has proven to be safely achievable in most patients, with no deleterious effects on patient or graft survival but with a great benefit in terms of reduction of incidence of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Long-term 'steroid-free' regimens are therefore now widely used. Patients with stable graft function can be easily maintained using a single drug usually after 6 or 12 months and usually with a calcineurin inhibitor. The more evolved step of using monotherapy ab initio has also proven to be effective in a few studies and needs to be explored further. In the future new strategies will be designed to help the development of tolerance of the allograft, selectively stimulating instead of suppressing the immune reaction of the recipient.", "answer": "The evolution of immunosuppressive protocols in liver transplantation has been driven by the need to reduce long-term drug-related morbidity and mortality, the successful withdrawal of corticosteroids, and the increasing use of single-agent immunosuppression.", "covered": false}

Malaysia enjoys a comprehensive range of health services, the government being committed to the principles of universal access to high quality health care, which the Ministry of Health provides through a wide variety of nation wide network of clinics and hospitals. One of the major problems is the availability of comprehensiveness and quality of health care in remote health centres. When patients are transferred from the health centres to the hospitals for further treatment, this not only incurs inconvenience to the patients and their family but also increases the cost to the health care system. Teleprimary care is one of the tools to overcome this problem. The doctors in the remote clinics are able to discuss the problem cases through teleconsultation with the doctors and specialist in the hospitals using an audiovisual system to provide better care in the health centers without transferring the patients to the hospitals. Only the essential and needy patients are referred to the hospitals. This has not only reduced the number of patients referred to the hospitals but it has reduced the cost to the health care system. It has also provided a more comprehensive care to the patients in the health centres. The doctors in the health centers are also provided training and are also updated on the latest in medicine.

Low bone density and large muscle mass predispose rabbits to femoral fractures. However, there are few reports describing treatment and prognosis. Two New Zealand White rabbits presented with unilateral left rear limb abduction and lateral rotation of the distal left rear limb 2 and 17 days after experimental surgery to create a \"stair step\" in the patellar groove of the left medial femoral chondyle. This procedure was performed after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Radiography revealed a spiral oblique mid-shaft fracture of the left femur in both rabbits. Open fracture reduction was undertaken. Because of the presence of screws and Kirschner-wires in the medial femoral condyle, a lateral approach to surgical correction was chosen. Intramedullary fixation was used to reduce and stabilize the fractures. A 0.062\" Kirschner wire was selected for the intramedullary device, because it was sufficiently flexible to allow easy passage into the femoral canal while being sufficiently stiff to promote reduction of the fracture. In addition, the ends of the fracture were secured with a 0.032\" Kirschner cerclage wire to provide additional control of rotation and angulation. Then we assessed the range of motion of the knee joint to determine fracture stability and ensure that the hardware did not impinge on soft-tissue elements. After closure and application of sterile dressing, the hind legs were hobbled proximal to the hock by using elastic veterinary wrap in a figure-eight pattern to maintain limb alignment and prevent formation of pressure ulcers. Intraoperative fluoroscopic evaluation and postoperative radiographs confirmed fracture reduction. Bruising and seroma formation occurred at the surgical site, and transient anorexia developed. Rabbits were treated with fluids, analgesics, antibiotics, and fitted with Elizabethan collars. They were housed in isolation to limit excessive environmental stimulation, which could alarm them and provoke \"thumping\" of the rear legs. Muscular weakness and atrophy developed in the affected legs, but the fractures remained immobilized. Radiographs obtained 21 days after surgery confirmed marked callus formation and integrity of the implanted hardware. Four weeks after surgical fixation, both rabbits showed increased muscle development in the repaired leg and were ambulating normally. The long-term prognosis was excellent. These cases demonstrate that repair of femoral fractures in rabbits can be achieved by using basic orthopedic techniques and diligent post-operative management.", "answer": "The spiral oblique mid-shaft fracture of the left femur in the rabbits was treated with open reduction, intramedullary fixation using a 0.062\" Kirschner wire, and stabilization with a 0.032\" Kirschner cerclage wire.", "covered": false}

[6] Superoxide is also capable of interacting with hypochlorite to form hydroxyl radicals in the neutrophil environment. [18] Inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-alpha, activate endogenous production of superoxide by NADPH oxidase, and loss of NADPH oxidase in cells leads to decreased inflammation in the vascular wall.

The association between the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component (E2) of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is clinically established. However, the detailed pathological function of the PDC-E2 gene is as yet unclear. In order to study the gene function in knockout and transgenic mouse models, we cloned and characterized the mouse PDC-E2 (mPDC-E2) gene. Because the expression level of PDC-E2 was elevated in PBC bile duct cells, we tried to construct a bile duct carcinoma cell line that overexpressed PDC-E2 as a PBC cell model. The mPDC-E2 cDNA was obtained by the 3'Race method. We overexpressed this gene in KMBC cells, using a retrovirus vector. The transcript and translated protein of mPDC-E2 were detected by Northern blot and Western blot, respectively. The deduced amino-acid sequence from the cloned cDNA indicated that the fully mature protein consisted of 557 amino-acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 59kD. This mature protein was highly consistent with those of previously reported rat and human PDC-E2, which possessed three structurally identifiable regions: the lipoyl-bearing domain, the E3-binding site, and the catalytic domain. Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells expressed one species of mPDC-E2 mRNA, 3.5kb in length. We also successfully constructed a stable KMBC cell line overexpressing the PDC-E2.

This research investigates language-general and language-specific properties of the acquisition of argument structure. Ten French preschoolers enacted forty sentences containing motion verbs; sixteen sentences were ungrammatical in that the syntactic frame was incompatible with the standard argument structure for the verb (e.g. *Le tigre va le lion = *The tiger goes the lion). Previous work (Naigles, Fowler &amp; Helm, 1992, 1995; Naigles, Gleitman &amp; Gleitman, 1993) indicated that English-speaking two-year-olds faced with such ungrammatical sentences consistently altered the usual meaning of the verb to fit the syntactic frame (frame compliance) whereas adults faced with the same sentences altered the syntax to fit the meaning of the verb (verb compliance). The age at which children began to perform Verb Compliantly varied by frame and by verb. The current study finds that the level of Verb Compliance in French five-year-olds largely mirrors that of English-speaking five-year-olds. The sole exception is the intransitive frame with an added prepositional phrase (e.g. *Le tigre amène près de la passerelle = *The tiger brings next to the ramp), which elicits a higher level of Verb Compliance among French kindergarteners than among their English learning peers. This effect may be due to the unambiguous interpretation of French spatial prepositions (i.e. next to has both locative and directional interpretations whereas près de supports only the locative interpretation). These data support the conclusion that the acquisition of argument structure is influenced by both language-general mechanisms (e.g. uniqueness, entrenchment) and language-specific properties (e.g. prepositional ambiguity).", "answer": "French and English-speaking preschoolers generally show similar levels of Verb Compliance when understanding ungrammatical sentences with motion verbs.

Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) protein, a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta-subunits, prevents mistargeting of nascent polypeptide chains to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. alpha-NAC has sequence similarities with transcription-regulating proteins and has been reported to function as a transcriptional coactivator potentiating c-Jun-mediated transcription. Performing gene hunting using differential display-polymerase chain reaction, a downregulated sequence in the frontal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) with AD-like neuropathology was identified as a-NAC with 100% homology. The significant decrease in alpha-NAC mRNA was shown by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in parallel, the significant decrease of alpha-NAC protein, which was even more pronounced when related to either actin or neuron-specific enolase levels, was also observed in both disorders. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong, significant correlation between alpha-NAC protein and mRNA expression. In fetal DS brain, however, mRNA levels of alpha-NAC were comparable between DS and controls, suggesting that the decrease in alpha-NAC might be involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. The decrease in alpha-NAC as a transcriptional coactivator could contribute to the characteristic decline of the c-Jun-mediated transcriptional machinery and could function as the complementary mechanism in c-Jun-mediated apoptosis.

A laboratory-scale microbubble dispersion (MBD) generator was shown to improve oxygen transfer to aerobic microorganisms when coupled to the conventional air-sparger. However, the process was not demonstrated on a large scale to prove its practical application. We investigated the scale-up of a spinning-disk MBD generator for the aerobic fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). A 1-L spinning-disk MBD generator was used to supply air for 1- and 50-L working volume fermentation of baker's yeast. For the two levels investigated, the MBD generator maintained an adequate supply of surfactant-stabilized air microbubbles to the microorganisms at a relatively low agitation rate (150 rpm). There was a significant improvement in oxygen transfer to the microorganism relative to the conventional sparger. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa, for the MBD system at 150 rpm was 765 h(-1) compared to 937 h(-1) for the conventional sparger at 500 rpm. It is plausible to surmise that fermentation using larger working volumes may further improve the kLa values and the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels because of longer hold-up times and, consequently, improve cell growth.

Effect of inserting the tetraamine backbone into a macrocyclic structure. The present article expands on the study of another aspect of structure-activity relationships of the polymethylene tetraamines, namely, the effect of inserting the tetraamine backbone into a macrocyclic structure. To this end, compounds 8-12 were designed by linking the two terminal nitrogen atoms of prototype methoctramine 2 to an aryl moiety. Alternatively, 2 was first modified to achieve compounds 6 and 7, which in turn were cyclized by linking the two terminal primary amine functions to a polyphenyl spacer, affording 13-20. All the compounds were tested on muscle-type nAChRs and most of them as well on AChE. Furthermore, selected compounds were tested also on peripheral M(2) and M(3) mAChRs. All these cyclic derivatives, like prototypes, were potent noncompetitive antagonists at both frog and Torpedo nAChRs, suggesting that polyamines do not need to be linear or in extended conformation to optimally interact with the nicotinic channel; rather, they may bind in a U-shaped conformation. Relative to muscarinic activity, macrocyclic compounds 10, 13, 14, and 20, in contrast with the profile displayed by 2, were almost devoid of affinity. It is derived that an aryl spacer is detrimental to the interaction of polyamines with mAChRs.

Other than avoiding the sun at peak hours and wearing protective clothing, using sunscreen is the single-best habit patients can develop to reduce their risk of skin cancer. Sunscreens come in various types and contain different ingredients that protect against the sun in different ways. Chemical ingredients, such as the frequently used para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and cinnamates, absorb solar rays and change UV rays into heat energy. Ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide work as a physical barrier that deflects UV rays off of the skin. Selecting sunscreens that are labeled as broad-spectrum is important because that indicates that the patient will be protected from both UVA and UVB rays. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, aside from creating great barrier protection, are excellent ingredients to look for in sunscreens due to their broad-spectrum UV coverage. [9] An important topic when counseling patients about skin cancer prevention is the sun protection factor (SPF). The SPF number represents the amount of protection from sunburn that sunscreen offers compared to using no sunscreen at all. For example, if a patient’s skin would normally take 10 minutes to burn and the patient appropriately applies SPF 30 sunscreen, it would take him or her 30 times longer (300 minutes) to burn. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a sunscreen with SPF 30, which filters out about 97% of UV rays from the sun.

Previous studies of the oim/oim mouse have focused on the musculoskeletal system, with no systematic evaluation of other organ systems. Multiple tissues from oim/oim, oim/+ (heterozygous) and +/+ (wild-type) mice were examined for gross and histological abnormalities. Tissues were stained with (1) hematoxylin and eosin (to assess lesion formation), (2) picrosirius red (collagen content), and (3) periodic acid methenamine silver (basement membrane). Kidneys were further evaluated ultrastructurally by electron microscopy and immunohistochemically with anti-alpha1(I) and anti-alpha1(III) collagen antibodies. Histological analyses revealed accumulations of picrosirius red-positive material, consistent with collagen, in glomeruli of 28/29 oim/oim mice, with no evidence of mesangial cell proliferation. Only the most severely affected animals had evidence of increased capillary basement membrane thickening or mild inflammation around the affected glomeruli.

Aim of the study was to examine if the addition of buffering sodiumhydrogenphosphate to poly(D,L)lactide(PDLLA) would stabilize the pH-value in the in vivo environment of implanted material and whether this improves its biocompatibility. The material was predegraded just to the point of viscous disintegration to test the PDLLA in the moment of its most aggressive effect on the surrounding tissue. Racemic amorphous PDLLA was injection-molded with or without the admixture of 1 mol NaP per 100 mol lactate, the degradation product of PDLLA (=1 mol%) to form 20mm x 3 mm x 2mm rods. Predegradation was performed by storing the rods at 55 degrees C for 14 days, just to the point of beginning dissolution. Predegraded PDLLA or PDLLA + NaP samples were used for in vitro incubation tests, as well as for the in vivo study, where the rods were implanted into the spinal muscles of 30 male Wistar rats. Repeatedly, measurements of the pH-value were made in the incubation solutions in vitro. The surrounding tissue of the implanted samples as well as the normal contralateral muscle tissue was checked for its pH-value in a group of 3 rats, respectively, anaesthesized at various time intervals after implantation. After these measurements the implants and their surrounding tissues were excised for histological examination. In Ringer's solution pH-values dropped immediately within the first week of incubation of both predegraded materials reaching -4 pH units after 4 weeks in the PDLLA containing medium, after 6 weeks in the PDLLA + NaP containing medium. Soerensen buffer slowed the pH decrease with significant differences between the material groups up to the 28th week. In vivo, the pH of the surrounding tissue was influenced by the implanted PDLLA material up to the 4th week, while the admixture of NaP resulted in a significant pH stabilization. A higher quantity of macrophages and giant cells were seen between the 2nd and 6th week after the implantation in the environment of pure PDLLA compared with PDLLA + NaP. Complete resorption of predegraded pure PDLLA or PDLLA + NaP from the extracellular space was reached 28 weeks postimplantation in vivo.

The WQ was answered by parents or guardians of children with atopic dermatitis (AE), aged 6-7 years (n = 23) and of non-AE control children of the same age (n = 46) as well as by AE (n = 24) and non-AE (n = 48) adolescents, aged 13-14 years. In order to evaluate the reproducibility of the ISAAC WQ, half of these individuals answered the same questionnaire after 2 to 4 weeks. The maximum possible global scores were 13 for the children aged 6-7 years and 11 for the adolescents, and the cutoff level for both groups was 3. In both age periods the WQ was reproducible (Kappa and McNemar tests) in a significant way (6-7 years, Kw = 0.79; 13-14 years, Kw = 0.73). The prevalence of AE, using the validated WQ, was then studied. The WQ was applied to the parents of 3,005 children aged 6-7 years and to 3008 children aged 13-14 years. Response rates were 72% and 94% for the 6-7-year-old children and the 13-14-year-old children, respectively. There was a slight predominance of male children in the studied population. In the group of the 6-7-year-old children, the cumulative prevalence of AE was 13.2% for boys and for girls; in the group of the 13-14-year-old children, it was 12.5% and 15.4%, respectively. AE severity was similar for both age groups. Using the criteria of global cutoff score, in the group of the 6-7-year-old children, the prevalence of AE was 12.6% for boys and 13.8 for girls; in the group of the 13-14-year-old children, it was 11.7% and 12.4%, respectively. There were no significant differences between them. In conclusion, the AE component of the ISAAC WQ proved to be reproducible, adequate, and able to discriminate between AE and control children. A significant concordance was observed between the criteria utilized in this study (ISAAC x global cutoff score).", "answer": "$The eczema component of the ISAAC's written questionnaire was validated in Brazil by having pediatric experts grade the questions, testing it on different groups, and assessing its reproducibility over time.", "covered": false}

The effect of moisture was studied by maintaining the treated soil samples (10 microg/g level) at field capacity and submerged condition. In general, flufenacet persisted for 60-90 days at lower and beyond 90 days at high rate. The dissipation of flufenacet from soil followed first order kinetics with half-life (DT50) values ranging from 10 to 31 days. The dissipation of flufenacet was faster at low rate than high rate of application. The slow dissipation at high rate could be attributed to inhibition of microbial activity at high rate.

Pooled survival rates from eight randomized trials that evaluated the role of cisplatin, alone or in combination with other chemotherapy agents, administered concurrently with external beam radiotherapy to patients with cervical cancer demonstrated a statistically significant effect in favour of cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy without cisplatin (relative risk [RR] of death, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.86).

The seasonal changes in the distribution of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) and its main host, cattle, were examined in a cultivated area of the plateau of eastern Zambia. During four consecutive years, the tsetse and cattle populations were monitored along a fly-round transect traversing the two main vegetation types in the study area. These were miombo, a one-storied open woodland with the genera Brachystegia and Julbernardia dominant, and munga, a one- or two-storied woodland where the principal tree genera were Acacia, Combretum and Terminalia. Concurrently, a capture/mark/release/recapture (CMRR) exercise was conducted along two other transects also traversing both vegetation types. The index of apparent abundance of tsetse (IAA) in miombo increased at the beginning of the rainy season (November), reached its peak at the end of the rainy season (April) and was low during the cold season (May to late August), but especially the hot dry season (September to late October). The IAA of tsetse in munga showed a pattern that was the reverse of that in miombo. The seasonal changes in the IAA of tsetse in both vegetation types were in accordance with changes in the movement patterns of tsetse between the two vegetation type as observed using CMRR. The distribution and abundance of cattle along the transect also showed a seasonal trend. This was especially so in munga, during the first three years of observations, where cattle abundance increased gradually from June onwards, reached a maximum at the end of the hot dry season (October-November) and declined steeply at the start of the rainy season (November-December). In both vegetation types, the monthly mean IAA of tsetse was positively correlated with the abundance of cattle in the previous month.

We have compared echocardiography (echo) and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the measurement of left ventricular (LV) volume and ejection fraction. Seventy asymptomatic patients were studied up to 12 days after first Q wave anterior myocardial infarction and again after 6 months. Each patient had LV volume measured by all three techniques within 24 hours of each other on each occasion. LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume index (LVESVI and LVEDVI) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured using the modified Simpson formula (echo), a counts-based method (RNV), and a multislice area summation method (MRI). Radionuclide volumes were measured both with and without correction for attenuation of isotope. Echocardiography overestimated LV volume compared with MRI. Mean (SD) differences (echo-MRI) were: LVEDVI + 10.6 ml/m2 (16.8), LVESVI + 13.7 ml/m2 (12.9), LVEF -8.5% (11.2). RNV underestimated both volume and ejection fraction compared with MRI. Mean differences (RNV-MRI) were: LVEDVI -25.4 ml/m2 (23.8), LVESVI -5.0 ml/m2 (18.6), LVEF -13.8% (10.4). Variability in the difference between echo and MRI and between RNV and MRI was very similar for LVEF (coefficient of variation 23.9% echo, 22.2% RNV) but there was greater variability in the radionuclide than the echo measurements of absolute volume. Variability of the radionuclide measurements was reduced by not correcting for attenuation, and this finding may improve the radionuclide technique for serial measurements of percentage change in volume. Long-term inter-study reproducibility of MRI for LVEF (coefficient of reproducibility) was 10.9%, for echo it was 10.6%, and for RNV it was 14.6%.

Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) is a non-pathogenic human parvovirus that is being developed as a gene therapy vector for the treatment of numerous diseases. One property of wild-type AAV-2, that is highly desirable in a gene therapy vector, is its ability to preferentially integrate its DNA into a 4 kilobase region of human chromosome 19, designated AAVS1. One disadvantage of AAV-2 is its relatively small packaging capacity, approximately 4.7 kilobases. Because of this size limitation, the AAV-2 rep and cap genes were removed from first-generation AAV-2-based gene therapy vectors to make room for the therapeutic or marker gene. It was later discovered that the rep gene, or at least one of its products, the Rep68 or Rep78 protein, is required for preferential integration of AAV-2. Recent developments in AAV-2 gene therapy vector construction allow the inclusion of the rep gene into a second generation of AAV-2-based gene therapy systems. These new systems fall into four major categories: plasmid-based systems, co-transduction with multiple AAV-2 vectors, incorporation of the AAV-2 vector into a larger virus, and in vitro packaging.

This research compared raw filtered waters (RFWs), XAD resin isolates (XAD-8 and XAD-4), and reverse osmosis (RO) isolates of several surface water samples from McDonalds Branch, a small freshwater fen in the New Jersey Pine Barrens (USA). RO and XAD-8 are two of the most common techniques used to isolate natural organic matter (NOM) for studies of composition and reactivity; therefore, it is important to understand how the isolates differ from bulk (unisolated) samples and from one another. Although, any comparison between the isolation methods needs to consider that XAD-8 is specifically designed to isolate the humic fraction, whereas RO concentrates a broad range of organic matter and is not specific to humics. The comparison included for all samples: weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), polydispersity (rho), absorbance at 280 nm normalized to moles C (epsilon280) (RFW and isolates); and for isolates only: elemental analysis, % carbon distribution by 13C NMR, and aqueous FTIR spectra. As expected, RO isolation gave higher yield of NOM than XAD-8, but also higher ash content, especially Si and S. Mw decreased in the order: RO &gt; XAD-8 &gt; RFW &gt; XAD-4. The Mw differences of isolates compared with RFW may be due to selective isolation (fractionation), or possibly in the case of RO to condensation or coagulation during isolation. 13C NMR results were roughly similar for the two methods, but the XAD-8 isolate was slightly higher in 'aromatic' C and the RO isolate was slightly higher in heteroaliphatic and carbonyl C. Infrared spectra indicated a higher carboxyl content for the XAD-8 isolates and a higher ester:carboxyl ratio for the RO isolates. The spectroscopic data thus are consistent with selective isolation of more hydrophobic compounds by XAD-8, and also with potential ester hydrolysis during that process, although further study is needed to determine whether ester hydrolysis does indeed occur. Researchers choosing between XAD and RO isolation methods for NOM need to consider first the purpose of the isolation; i.e., whether humic fractionation is desirable. Beyond that, they should consider the C yield and ash content, as well as the potential for alteration of NOM by ester hydrolysis (XAD) or condensation/coagulation (RO).

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of Aroclor 1242, a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), on plumage characteristics and molt in the American kestrel, Falco sparverius. Several characteristics of plumage, including color and molt schedule, are modulated by hormonal signals and hence may be modified by endocrine-active contaminants. If so, the functions of plumage (e.g., communication for mating or territorial defense) may be compromised by exposure to such compounds. Captive American kestrels were fed Aroclor 1242 at 0, 6.0, and 60.0 ppm (n = 6 males and 6 females per treatment) mixed in their normal diet. Concentrations of plasma estradiol and thyroxine were measured weekly from the beginning of treatment. Measured plumage characteristics included width of the black subterminal band on the tail, color (a composite index of hue and saturation), reflectance from 230 to 800 nm. pattern of feather loss and regrowth on the tail and wing, and timing of onset and duration of molt. Aroclor 1242 depressed plasma thyroxine. Plasma estradiol levels remained low due to the phase of the breeding cycle. Treatments did not disrupt the measured plumage characteristics.

The introduction of species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approaches to ecological risk assessment offers the potential for a more transparent scientific basis for the derivation of predicted no-effect concentrations. However, conventional SSD methodologies have relied on standard distributions (e.g., log logistic, log normal) that are not necessarily based on sound ecological or statistical grounds. More recently, bootstrap resampling techniques that do not rely on distributional assumptions have been applied to the problem. Here we describe how a more advanced bootstrap methodology may be applied to derive better point estimates and confidence intervals for SSD estimates of safe environmental concentrations. Motivated by the fact that the true SSD may not fit any standard model category, we go on to consider a hybrid bootstrap regression approach. This can yield a substantially different estimate for the SSD when compared with both the basic bootstrap and the more frequently used parametric curve approaches. With increasing use of SSDs in ecological risk assessment, it is now imperative that the scientific community develops agreement over appropriate methods for their derivation.", "answer": "Conventional SSD methodologies differ from bootstrap resampling techniques in that the former rely on standard statistical distributions, which may not be ecologically or statistically justified, while the latter do not rely on distributional assumptions and provide more flexible and robust estimates.", "covered": false}

Within this theoretical framework we consider here a difficult case of classification of species: the Callithrix jacchus group of the New World monkeys. Although the morphological analysis strongly suggests the individuation of six different species, nevertheless several experiments of crossing give evidence to fertility of hybrids. Since both the morphological and the hybridological criteria have shown to be of enormous importance in actual classification of species, this apparent contradiction seems very disappointing. Our axiomatization of speciation processes as operations acting in special time intervals permits to avoid the contradiction by allowing for individuals which, during such special periods, may belong to more than one species.

Square fields with widths ranging from 1 cm to 15 cm were observed; the OF for the different field sizes was normalized to that measured at a 5 cm x 5 cm field size at a depth of 10 cm. The BEAM/EGS4 program was used to simulate the exact geometry of a 6 MV photon beam generated by the linear accelerator, and the DOSXYZ-code was implemented to calculate the OFs for all field sizes. Two resolutions (0.1 cm and 0.5 cm voxel size) were chosen here. In addition, to model the detector four kinds of material, water, air, graphite or silicon, were placed in the corresponding voxels. Profiles and depth dose distributions resulting from the simulation show good agreement with the measurements. Deviations of less than 2% can be observed.

Aging resulted in higher concentration of both compounds and smaller bacterial activity in the solution-phase. Surprisingly, the total biodegraded extent was greater in the aged soil system than in the freshly spiked system. As anticipated, biostimulation was not appropriate to attain an effective biodegradation in this study, and bioaugmentation achieved a substantial increase the total biodegradation extent. The above findings were attributed to indigenous Pseudomonas aeruginosa entering a stationary-phase during the 200-day aging and producing rhamnolipid biosurfactants. In addition, a different sampling technique (i.e., after vigorous hand-shaking) revealed a 15 times higher microbial population than the normal sampling from the stagnant solution.

The cloned vanilloid (capsaicin) receptor subtype 1 (VR1) integrates multiple noxious stimuli on peripheral terminals of primary sensory neurons. The initial excitation of these neurons is followed by a lasting refractory state, traditionally termed desensitization, that has clear therapeutic potential. Capsaicin is used to relieve neuropathic pain, uremic pruritus, and bladder overactivity. The ultrapotent vanilloid resiniferatoxin, now in phase 2 clinical trials, has improved tolerability. A less recognized human exposure to high capsaicin concentrations may occur by pepper sprays used in law enforcement. Evidence is mounting that VR1 expression is not restricted to sensory neurons. From the olfactory bulb to the cerebellum, VR1-expressing neurons are present in a number of brain nuclei, where they might be activated by anandamide. VR1 presence also was demonstrated in nonneuronal tissues. These discoveries place VR1 in a much broader perspective than pain perception and enhance the potential for unforeseen side effects, especially following prolonged vanilloid therapy. The expression of VR1 is plastic and down-regulated during vanilloid therapy, which might have a pivotal role in desensitization. Good evidence suggests altered VR1 expression in various disease states.

Several case-control and large prospective studies focusing on dietary assessment suggest that the intake of tomatoes and tomato products may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer [18]. Although less certain at present, the accumulated data suggest that the benefit may be most pronounced in the protection against more advanced or aggressive prostate cancer. It is possible that lycopene is one of the compounds in raw and processed tomato products that may contribute to a lower risk of prostate cancer; however, this hypothesis remains to be further investigated. Other carotenoids and phytochemicals in tomato products may also contribute to the proposed health benefits. Food processing does not seem to reduce the benefits but may, in fact, enhance the bioavailability of beneficial components. The reported correlations or associations between the consumption of tomato products and prostate cancer risk should not be interpreted as causal until additional data are available from a variety of studies in different populations. Ideally, randomized controlled intervention studies would provide an ultimate test of the tomato/lycopene hypothesis; however, the expense, long duration of exposure, and the near universal consumption of tomato products among Americans make a dietary intervention study difficult to undertake. It is reasonable to recommend to the general population the consumption of tomato products at approximately one serving per day or five servings per week as part of an overall healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risks of prostate cancer, other malignancies, or other chronic diseases. This recommendation is consistent with current dietary guidelines to increase fruit and vegetable consumption to lower the risk of heart disease and many types of cancer [38]. Nutritional prevention of prostate cancer is very different from the use of dietary or nutritional treatments for established prostate cancer. The use of lycopene and other extracts for the treatment of prostate cancer is a separate issue that warrants individual attention and investigation.", "answer": "Lycopene, other carotenoids, and phytochemicals.", "covered": false}

A total of 311 non-medullary thyroid tumours were identified and divided into: 29 follicular carcinoma (FC), 12 Hürthle cell carcinoma (HC), 13 Hürthle cell papillary thyroid carcinoma (HPTC) with vascular invasion (VI), 32 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with VI and 225 PTC without VI. The mean follow-up was 6.5 years with a range of 1-17 years. The tumours were histologically subdivided into minimal or wide invasion for FC and HC and focal or extensive invasion for PTC and HPTC, and stratified according to status of VI. The rate of distant metastasis was similar for FC, malignant Hürthle cell tumours and PTC with VI, and increased with extent of invasion. VI was seen in 12% of all PTC and 0% of HPTC in this study. PTC without VI were associated with a much lower potential of distant metastasis, were smaller in size and occurred in patients of younger age than PTC with VI. In addition, there was a tendency for increased potential for distant metastases with increased tumour size and patient age for all groups of tumours in the study. Patient age and tumour size appeared to play a smaller role than that of VI in predicting distant metastasis.

In our institution we performed 16 consecutive APOLTs in 15 patients between October 1992 and December 1999. Patients' mean age was 30 years (range 0.5-65 years). The causes of FHF were viral (HAV = 3; HBV = 3), drugs (n = 4), or others (n = 5). None of the patients had a history of chronic liver disease. The decision to transplant was taken when the patients met well-defined criteria. All but one of the patients were in a coma. Five patients died, 10 patients are alive (66.7%). Regeneration of the NL occurred in 11 of the 15 patients (73.3%) and in 8 of the 10 survivors. Six of these 8 patients have permanently stopped immunosuppressive therapy.

APOLT is feasible in both adults and children; it rapidly restored liver function and reversed encephalopathy. Right APOLT seems more advisable since the right liver provides more functional hepatocytes; however, left APOLT harvested in an adult appears sufficient for a child.

Several characteristics of plumage, including color and molt schedule, are modulated by hormonal signals and hence may be modified by endocrine-active contaminants. If so, the functions of plumage (e.g., communication for mating or territorial defense) may be compromised by exposure to such compounds.

An update of incidence, mortality, and clinical factors from the SEER database. Concurrent with the successful life-saving efforts in terms of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, some men who do not need treatment are receiving it. These are men destined to die of causes other than prostate cancer. Unfortunately, at diagnosis, men needing treatment for prostate cancer cannot be differentiated from men who do not. To make such decisions correctly for individual patients would require extremely precise measures of the time to death from prostate cancer versus when the patient would die from a competing cause. Predictive tools with this level of accuracy will never be available given the inherent uncertainty of life. At the time of prostate cancer diagnosis, the date and the cause of death for the patient are matters of weak statistical speculation. Unless the date of death from prostate cancer and the date of death from non-prostate cancer causes can be precisely determined for each patient, some men will always be overtreated or undertreated. Conservative strategies result in the undertreatment of some patients who would benefit from treatment while sparing other patients unneeded treatment. Aggressive strategies result in the overtreatment of patients who do not need therapy while curing other men of prostate cancer. Both strategies are correct, but only some of the time. Better methods of determining the length of life and cause of death may improve this situation, but not by much. [figure: see text] Dramatic shifts in the incidence, grade, stage, and age of men with prostate cancer have been observed with the advent of widespread PSA-based cancer detection in the United States. Grade and stage trends suggest that more biologically relevant (the shift from well-differentiated to moderately differentiated tumors) and yet therapeutically amenable (earlier stage) tumors have been identified in large numbers of patients during the PSA era. Clearly many men have been diagnosed and treated who will not benefit from such treatment. The relative mix of these two groups of men is not known. Given the long delay between treatment and mortality that is inherent in prostate cancer (Fig. 14), the full effects of treatment on prostate cancer mortality are probably not yet seen in prostate cancer mortality data.", "answer": "It is difficult to differentiate men who require treatment for prostate cancer from those who do not because precise predictive tools required to measure the time to death from prostate cancer versus death from other causes are not available.", "covered": false}

The only drug that effectively reduces the virus is interferon, but complete eradication of the virus can be obtained in only 30%-40% of treated patients. Reevaluation of the predictive factors to eradicate the virus by 24-week interferon therapy showed that the genotype other than 1b, a low virus load, and multiple amino acid substitutions in the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) of genotype 1b are statistically significant predictive factors. Amino acid substitution in the PePHD domain of the E2 protein was rare and was unrelated with the outcome of interferon therapy. The fluctuation of the virus titer measured by branched DNA during a 2-year observation period was less that 10-fold in most patients, and amino acid substitutions in the ISDR were rare in such patients, suggesting that one point measurement of these parameters may be useful to select candidates for interferon therapy. A comparison of patients treated with interferon and untreated patients from the viewpoint of cancer prevention showed only a slight decrease in the risk of treated patients developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

The genetic make-up of gastric cancers in low-risk population groups from South Africa is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the incidence of microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity in this population. Thirty-seven gastrectomy specimens for sporadic gastric cancer were analysed for the following clinicopathological parameters: age, gender, race, histopathological type, size of tumour, lymph node status and the presence/absence of Helicobacter pylori. DNA was then extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue and seven microsatellite markers in 2p, 3p, 5q and 18q loci were examined using automated DNA fluorescent technology. Only eight cases showed microsatellite instability (MSI) for one marker and were thus categorised as MSI-low. In the 3p region, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in 21.7-38.3% of informative cases, whilst in the 18q region CLOH ranged from 25 to 38.4%. LOH was not seen in the 2p locus and only one case showed LOH in the 5q region.

One of the major hurdles to successful gene therapy of genetic and/or acquired disease is the ability to efficiently introduce a foreign gene into the tissue of interest and, in the case of some genetic diseases, achieve long-term expression of the transgene. Due to their ability to transduce a wide variety of cell types in a cell-cycle independent fashion, adenovirus (Ad)-based vectors have received considerable attention in recent years as delivery vehicles for multiple gene therapy applications. Effective use of early \"first-generation\" versions of these vectors was hampered by not only the induction of strong immune responses in the host to the Ad vector and transduced cells, but also to direct acute and chronic toxicity caused by the vector itself. Furthermore, transgene expression was typically transient, lasting only a few weeks. Despite these limitations, these vectors have been used in a number of human clinical trials, eliciting both interesting as well as controversial results, some of which are summarized herein. Because of these limitations, a number of advances in adenovirus \"vectorology\", manifested primarily as the development of multiply attenuated Ads and vectors deleted of all viral protein coding sequences, has resulted in vectors which retain all of the advantages of Ad vectors and, in addition, do not exhibit the deleterious characteristics associated with [E1-]deleted Ads.

Prior to MIP, a localization study is critical to guide operative planning. The gold standard of parathyroid localization is single-radioisotope scintigraphy with technetium-99m (99mTc). In this study, the radioisotope is administered, and either planar or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging follows. An alternative is dual-radioisotope imaging, in which both 99mTc pertechnetate and thallium-201 (201Tl) are given. Thallium is taken up by both the thyroid and parathyroid, while pertechnetate only has avidity for the thyroid. Subtraction imaging is then used to visualize the glands. Drawbacks to this method include the necessity of a subtraction program, long imaging times, and limited views. Other methods of localization such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound are available but are less sensitive.", "answer": "CT, MRI, and ultrasound are less sensitive for parathyroid localization compared to single-radioisotope scintigraphy with technetium-99m (99mTc) because the context explicitly states that these methods are less sensitive.", "covered": true}

Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA, is thought to be necessary for cellular immortality and carcinogenesis. Telomerase activity is associated with the majority of malignant human cancers. The mRNA that encodes the telomerase catalytic subunit (human telomerase repeat transcriptase; hTERT) has recently been identified, and the expression of the hTERT gene is thought to regulate the activation of telomerase. However, the expression of hTERT mRNA in esophageal tissues has not been reported. We investigated hTERT gene expression in cancerous and noncancerous esophageal tissues, and determined the relationship between hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity. Tissues from esophageal carcinomas in 14 patients, reflux esophagitis in 12 patients, esophageal acanthosis in 2 patients, esophageal papilloma in 1 patient, radiation esophagitis in 1 patient, and normal esophageal epithelium in 11 patients (including 3 specimens of normal epithelium from patients with esophageal carcinoma) were examined. All specimens were taken endoscopically. hTERT gene expression was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Quantitative analysis of telomerase activity was analyzed by fluorescence telomeric repeat amplification protocol (F-TRAP) assay. Thirteen of the 14 (93%) esophageal carcinoma specimens expressed hTERT mRNA and revealed detectable telomerase activity. Noncancerous esophageal lesions had not only hTERT mRNA expression with a high frequency (14 of 16 cases; 88%) but also detectable telomerase activity (12 of 13 cases; 92%). Normal esophageal epithelium also highly expressed hTERT mRNA (10 of 11 cases; 91%) and revealed detectable telomerase activity (all 9 cases; 100%). In 32 of the 35 specimens analyzed for both hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity (91%), the expression of hTERT mRNA was consistent with detectable telomerase activity. The expression of hTERT mRNA was detected not only in cancerous but also in noncancerous esophageal tissues at a high frequency. This result was different from that reported for other gastrointestinal epithelium. Moreover, telomerase activity in esophageal carcinoma was significantly stronger than that in reflux esophagitis and normal epithelium. In addition, there was a strong relation ship between the detection of telomerase activity and the expression of hTERT mRNA in cancerous and noncancerous esophageal tissues. Thus, the qualitative analysis of hTERT mRNA expression may not be useful as a biomarker of carcinoma in esophageal tissues. Nevertheless, the quantitative analysis of telomerase activity may be somewhat useful.", "answer": "Yes, there is a difference in telomerase activity in esophageal carcinoma compared to reflux esophagitis and normal epithelium; it is significantly stronger in esophageal carcinoma.", "covered": false}

In this paper, Rayleigh wave (RW) acousto-elastic coefficients of an orthotropic material are theoretically determined according to its characteristics, i.e. the density and the secondand third-order elastic constants. Then, these RW acousto-elastic coefficients are directly measured during an experimental stage and a comparison between calculated and measured coefficients is realized.

A systematic review with economic analysis of published randomised clinical trials (available to March 2001) comparing early hospital discharge and domiciliary rehabilitation with usual care in patients with stroke was conducted. From included studies, data were extracted on study quality; major clinical outcomes including hospital stay, death, institutionalisation, disability, and readmission rates; and resource use associated with hospital stay, rehabilitation, and community services. The resources were priced using Australian dollars ($A) healthcare costs. The outcomes and costs of the new intervention were compared with standard care. Seven published trials involving 1277 patients (54% men; mean age 73 years) were identified. The pooled data showed that overall, a policy of early hospital discharge and domiciliary rehabilitation reduced total length of stay by 13 days [95% confidence interval (CI): -19 to -7 days].

Ralstonia pickettii has emerged as a bioburden microorganism of considerable importance in pharmaceutical processes utilizing conventional 0.2 or 0.22 micron rated \"sterilizing grade\" filters.

The castor plant, Ricinus communis , is known to have a toxic chemical called ricin. If an individual eats Ricinus seeds directly, the ricin toxin can take effect in as little as 4 to 12 hours. Signs and symptoms of ricin toxicity include gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, pulmonary edema, and inflammation. These symptoms occur due to the inactivating effect of ricin toxin on ribosomes making the body unable to create proteins. The clinician needs to provide supportive care to the patient during ricin toxicity as currently, there is no antidote. The extraction process of castor oil due to ricin's water-soluble properties negates these toxic properties. [10] Castor oil gets purified of ricin during the extraction process. Castor oil is completely safe for human consumption with minimal toxic effects in both acute and chronic settings. Castor oil has also demonstrated no genotoxic effects.

This study sought to evaluate the long-term prognostic significance of stress-redistribution-reinjection Tl-201 imaging in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and coronary artery bypass surgery. Preoperative stress-redistribution-reinjection Tl-201 imaging detects viable but asynergic segments which show functional improvement postoperatively and is considered as a valuable noninvasive method in selection of patients with severe LV dysfunction for revascularization. The long-term prognostic value of the reinjection technique remains unclear. Fifty-two patients with severe LV dysfunction (mean ejection fraction (EF) 0.32+/-0.03) who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in 1993-1994 were included in the study. Patients had follow-up 49+/-12 months. LV function was assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Perfusion was assessed by Tl-201 SPECT imaging and was graded on a four-point scale (0 = normal, 3 = absent uptake) using the 20 segment model. Perfusion index was derived by adding the score of all segments and dividing these by 20. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised patients with seven and more dysfunctional viable myocardial segments. Group B included patients with less than seven dysfunctional but viable segments. Mean EF increased from 0.32+/-0.03 to 0.46+/-0.04. Mean perfusion index did not show a significant difference as a whole during follow-up compared to the early postoperative values (0.9+/-0.4 and 1.1+/-0.4, p = NS). When adequacy of revascularization was considered, the predictive value of a positive preoperative viability test for functional improvement was 82%. Nineteen cardiac events occurred in group B patients and six in group A patients: six deaths (four from cardiac and two from noncardiac causes), 13 myocardial infarctions (MI). Multivariate Cox survival analysis identified the number of viable segments detected preoperatively (chi2 = 7.2, p = 0.002), postoperative improvement in Tl-uptake (chi2 = 6.6, p = 0.01) and functional improvement (chi2 = 5.3, p = 0.03) postoperatively as independent predictors of cardiac events. Preoperative EF and functional capacity were not associated with cardiac events in long-term prognosis.

Peat generally has a high adsorption capacity and has been suggested as an adsorbent for metals in polluted waters. However, the adsorption potential of peat can be expected to be strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the water. In this study, the effect of pH, ionic strength (CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations), and metal concentration on Cu and Zn adsorption onto poorly humified Sphagnum and Carex peat was investigated in batch experiments using a fractional factorial experimental design. The pH value was varied between 4 and 8, the CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations between 1.2-6.2 and 0.4-43 mM, respectively, and the Cu and Zn concentrations between 0.05 and 0.5 mM. The amount of Zn adsorbed increased more with increasing pH than the amount of Cu adsorbed. The effect of NaCl/CaCl2 concentration was minor. It was found that Zn adsorption in particular, but also Cu adsorption, increased more with pH onto Carex peat than onto Sphagnum peat. In the pH interval 4-8, the removal of Zn from the solution increased from 0% to 80% using Carex peat and from 10% to 65% using Sphagnum peat as the adsorbent. The Carex peat sample decreased the Cu concentration by 80% at pH 4 and by 95% at pH 8 and for Sphagnum peat a decrease of 85% was maintained in the pH range investigated. The differences between Sphagnum and Carex peat were attributed to the habitat conditions at the time of peat formation. Carex peat has higher ash, nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, while Sphagnum peat contains a higher amount of uronic acid. In treating polluted waters with peat, a higher degree of metal removal can be expected at high pH values than at low. The removal of Cu, which has a high affinity to the peat surface, was less dependent on pH than Zn removal.

The data presented herein, although highly supportive for a protective role of various nutrients against bladder cancer, are far from definitive. Many authorities question the validity of current recommendations for nutritional chemoprevention against bladder cancer. The reason for the wide variations reported in epidemiologic studies lies in the nature of observational studies. Dietary studies are limited in their conclusions because the protection afforded by the consumption of a particular nutrient may be multifactorial, with different components of the food exerting potential chemopreventive effects. Furthermore, measuring levels of nutrients in the food intake of populations is confounded by factors that might affect these levels and also the incidence of cancer. For example, vitamin A can come from animal or vegetarian sources. Because animal fat has been identified as a potential carcinogen in man, depending on the source of the vitamin, varying levels of protection might be deduced. In addition, chemoprevention studies using dietary supplements are expected to have mild effects, and large studies would be required to confirm statistical significance. Even with agents such as intravesical chemotherapy, only half the studies achieve statistical significance [29]. Prospective randomized trials with a large sample size, longer follow-up, and an extended duration of treatment are needed to clarify the association between micronutrients and cancer protection. With these caveats in mind, several recommendations can be made. Simple measures, such as drinking more fluids (especially water), can have a profound impact on the incidence of bladder cancer. Vitamins are being extensively studied in chemopreventive trials for different cancers. There is strong evidence for a chemoprotective effect of vitamin A in bladder cancer. The authors recommend 32,000 IU/day of vitamin A initially, with lower doses (24,000 IU) for persons less than 50 kg. Because liver toxicity is a possibility with long-term administration, the dose should be decreased to 16,000 IU after 3 years. High doses of beta-carotene should be avoided based on a large clinical trial reporting a 25% increase in the number of cases of prostate cancer and a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer. Vitamin B6 has been studied in several clinical trials in bladder cancer. The US-based Veterans Administration cooperative study found benefit for vitamin B6 when given as a single agent. Data for vitamins C and E are insufficient to recommend either agent as stand-alone treatment. Nonetheless, each of these vitamins is known to have beneficial effects, including improved function of the immune system. It is possible that only a small percentage of patients with bladder cancer respond to vitamins B6, C, or E, yet each is safe, nontoxic, and inexpensive. In an effort to pool the efficacy of individual agents and to increase the power of study, the authors evaluated the combination of vitamins A, B6, C, and E in a double-blind trial. The observed 50% 5-year reduction in tumor recurrence was highly significant and greater than would be expected for any of the individual ingredients and suggests that combinations of nutritional agents may be most appropriate. A large-volume study along similar lines is being conducted. Among the numerous other compounds and dietary substances purported to have chemopreventive effect, soybeans, garlic, and green tea stand out as having the greatest promise and can freely be recommended to patients. For synthetically synthesized agents such as celecoxib, piroxicam, or DFMO, recommendations must be deferred until the results of clinical trials are conclusively in favor of their use. Many of the dietary factors found to be protective against bladder cancer are being investigated in other cancers and are beneficial to general health. Although naturally occurring nutrients are ideal, especially because the delicate balance of various micronutrients might be impossible to synthesize in the laboratory, the general population finds it easier to take vitamin supplements. Unfortunately, dietary changes such as decreasing fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake are more difficult to initiate. There is a mistaken notion that simply because an agent is naturally occurring, it cannot be as beneficial as taking a substance synthesized in the laboratory. Even in a high-risk group such as nuclear-bomb survivors in Japan, high consumption of vegetables and fruit is protective against bladder cancer [44]. Encouraging patients to follow an essentially healthy food habit lifestyle will be a significant contribution in the fight against cancer.", "answer": "Drinking more fluids, especially water, can have a profound impact on reducing the incidence of bladder cancer.", "covered": false}

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries. The poor prognosis associated with this disease is closely related to the fact that most lung cancer patients are not identified until their malignancy has reached an advanced stage. Recent advances have added to the understanding of the morphological and molecular characteristics of preinvasive bronchial lesions and early lung cancers. Such information is being used to provide new tests for the detection of lung cancer at early or preinvasive stages, and for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention that can prevent progression to advanced disease. Laser induced fluorescence endoscope bronchoscopy has improved the sensitivity with which preinvasive dysplastic bronchial lesions and early invasive malignancies can be detected. Morphological features of such lesions have been described and can be monitored by follow-up bronchoscopies in order to validate potential chemoprevention treatments. Distinct morphological characteristics such as angiogenic squamous dysplasia also suggest that processes like angiogenesis are present early in the development of lung cancer. Furthermore, tissue obtained from these early lesions has been used to describe alterations in the expression of a number of factors that distinguish these early lesions from normal bronchial epithelium. This could provide molecular markers and targets for the detection and treatment of early lung cancer. Studies to detect these alterations by polymerase chain reaction and/or immunhistochemical analyses of easily obtained specimens such as sputa are helping identifing molecular markers that could be utilized in effective screening programmes.

Effect of inserting the tetraamine backbone into a macrocyclic structure. The present article expands on the study of another aspect of structure-activity relationships of the polymethylene tetraamines, namely, the effect of inserting the tetraamine backbone into a macrocyclic structure. To this end, compounds 8-12 were designed by linking the two terminal nitrogen atoms of prototype methoctramine 2 to an aryl moiety. Alternatively, 2 was first modified to achieve compounds 6 and 7, which in turn were cyclized by linking the two terminal primary amine functions to a polyphenyl spacer, affording 13-20. All the compounds were tested on muscle-type nAChRs and most of them as well on AChE. Furthermore, selected compounds were tested also on peripheral M(2) and M(3) mAChRs. All these cyclic derivatives, like prototypes, were potent noncompetitive antagonists at both frog and Torpedo nAChRs, suggesting that polyamines do not need to be linear or in extended conformation to optimally interact with the nicotinic channel; rather, they may bind in a U-shaped conformation. Relative to muscarinic activity, macrocyclic compounds 10, 13, 14, and 20, in contrast with the profile displayed by 2, were almost devoid of affinity. It is derived that an aryl spacer is detrimental to the interaction of polyamines with mAChRs.

Ion chromatography (IC) is widely used for the compliance monitoring of common inorganic anions in drinking water. However, there has recently been considerable interest in the development of IC methods to meet regulatory requirements for analytes other than common inorganic anions, including disinfection byproduct anions, perchlorate, and haloacetic acids. Many of these new methods require the use of large injection volumes, high capacity columns and analyte specific detection schemes, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or postcolumn reaction with UV-Vis detection, in order to meet current regulatory objectives.

Concentrations in 47 soil samples collected in 1992 from natural sites of Latium (an area around Rome) have been determined for a first assessment of natural background levels. The Pt concentrations in Rome urban soils collected in 1992 range from 0.8 to 6.3 ng/g (mean = 3.8 +/- 1.0) overlapping the concentration range of natural soils from Latium (mean = 3.1 +/- 2.1 ng/g).

In recent years generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has become a much better defined disorder, with specific criteria distinguishing it from the other anxiety disorders; however, it still lacks the same public and scientific interests as some of the other anxiety disorders such as panic and social phobia. Nevertheless, refinement in the treatment of GAD is becoming more evident through the conduct of clinical trials. Up until the mid-1980's, treatment consisted primarily of benzodiazepines. However, as a result of growing characterisation of their abuse potential, other therapeutic options were explored. Benzodiazepines became seen as an effective short-term therapy, and buspirone and some of the newer antidepressants have become the treatment of choice for patients with GAD requiring long-term treatment. Buspirone was the first available alternative to the benzodiazepines in the US; however, the initial excitement over this agent was somewhat dampened because of its mild efficacy combined with a slow onset of action. The antidepressants were seen as beneficial for the treatment of GAD because of the high comorbidity with depression, thus allowing a better outcome for these patients. The antidepressants that offer both a good adverse effect profile and efficacy are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including paroxetine, and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine. Clinicians should also consider the potential benefits of psychotherapy as an adjunct to medication.

Although Helicobacter pylori eradication is effective in treating low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the condition in some patients deteriorates even after the eradication. Therefore, it is important to predict the disease outcome before starting H. pylori eradication. We investigated the usefulness of flow cytometry, quantifying CD19- and CD20-positive B lymphocytes in MALT lymphoma tissue, for predicting the disease outcome after H. pylori eradication. Tissue specimens from 14 patients with H. pylori-positive low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma were examined by histology, Southern blotting, and flow cytometry before therapy. Serum levels of soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor were also measured. The relationship between the data and the prognosis after H. pylori eradication was analyzed. Remission occurred in 10 of the 14 patients. The condition in the 4 remaining patients deteriorated even after H. pylori eradication. The percentages of CD19- and CD20-positive cells in MALT lymphoma tissue from the patients in remission were both significantly lower than those in the tissue from patients not in remission.

Effect of inserting the tetraamine backbone into a macrocyclic structure. The present article expands on the study of another aspect of structure-activity relationships of the polymethylene tetraamines, namely, the effect of inserting the tetraamine backbone into a macrocyclic structure. To this end, compounds 8-12 were designed by linking the two terminal nitrogen atoms of prototype methoctramine 2 to an aryl moiety. Alternatively, 2 was first modified to achieve compounds 6 and 7, which in turn were cyclized by linking the two terminal primary amine functions to a polyphenyl spacer, affording 13-20. All the compounds were tested on muscle-type nAChRs and most of them as well on AChE. Furthermore, selected compounds were tested also on peripheral M(2) and M(3) mAChRs. All these cyclic derivatives, like prototypes, were potent noncompetitive antagonists at both frog and Torpedo nAChRs, suggesting that polyamines do not need to be linear or in extended conformation to optimally interact with the nicotinic channel; rather, they may bind in a U-shaped conformation. Relative to muscarinic activity, macrocyclic compounds 10, 13, 14, and 20, in contrast with the profile displayed by 2, were almost devoid of affinity. It is derived that an aryl spacer is detrimental to the interaction of polyamines with mAChRs. Finally, all the diamine diamides investigated in this study were much less potent in inhibiting AChE activity than prototype 3, suggesting that a macrocyclic structure may not be suitable for AChE inhibition.", "answer": "Compounds 8-12 were designed by linking the two terminal nitrogen atoms of prototype methoctramine 2 to an aryl moiety.", "covered": false}

Cognitive vitality is essential to quality of life and survival in old age. With normal aging, cognitive changes such as slowed speed of processing are common, but there is substantial interindividual variability, and cognitive decline is clearly not inevitable.

Most of these factors are potentially modifiable or manageable, and some are protective. For example, animal and human studies suggest that lifelong learning, mental and physical exercise, continuing social engagement, stress reduction, and proper nutrition may be important factors in promoting cognitive vitality in aging. Manageable medical comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, also contribute to cognitive decline in older persons. Other comorbidities such as smoking and excess alcohol intake may contribute to cognitive decline, and avoiding these activities may promote cognitive vitality in aging.

Stormwater runoff was monitored on 13 separate urban watersheds, which were chosen to represent distinct types of residential and industrial development, along with various watershed characteristics. A total of 38 storm events were monitored to investigate the first flush phenomenon. The first flush phenomenon may be defined as the initial period of stormwater runoff during which the concentration of pollutants is substantially higher than during later stages. The magnitude of the first flush phenomenon, and if it actually occurs, was calculated using a method of data analysis which results in determining the 'event mean concentration' (EMC). The magnitude of the first flush phenomenon was found to be greater for some pollutants (e.g. suspended solids from residential areas) and less for others (e.g. chemical oxygen demand from industrial areas). No correlation was observed between the first flush phenomenon and the antecedent dry weather period, however, the first flush phenomenon was greater for smaller watershed areas.", "answer": "The first flush phenomenon is the initial period of stormwater runoff where pollutant concentrations are significantly higher than in later stages.", "covered": false}

Endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (DLIS) was first reported in volume-expanded dogs. Its presence has been confirmed in blood, urine, and other body fluids. Elevated DLIS concentrations are encountered in patients with volume-expanded conditions such as uremia, essential hypertension, liver disease, and preeclampsia. DLISs cross-react with antidigoxin antibodies and falsely elevate serum digoxin concentrations, interfering in interpretation of results for therapeutic digoxin monitoring. Falsely lower digoxin values due to the presence of DLISs have been reported. The association of DLISs with volume expansion led to speculation that they could be natriuretic hormones. Several structures have been proposed for DLISs, including nonesterified fatty acid, phospholipid, lysophospholipid, bile acid, bile salt, and steroid. Exogenous DLISs can be found in serum after ingestion of various Chinese medicines and therapy with spironolactone, canrenone, or potassium canrenoate. Like endogenous DLISs, exogenous DLISs interfere with serum digoxin assays, complicating therapeutic digoxin monitoring. However, most reported endogenous and exogenous DLISs are strongly protein-bound while digoxin is weakly protein-bound. Therefore, interference of both endogenous and exogenous DLISs in serum digoxin measurement can be eliminated by monitoring digoxin concentrations in the protein-free ultrafiltrates.", "answer": "uremia, essential hypertension, liver disease, and preeclampsia.", "covered": false}

Utilization of chemotherapy for treatment of tumors is mainly limited by its hematological toxicity. Because of the low level expression of drug resistance genes, transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) or multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) genes should provide protection from chemotherapy toxicity. Successful transfer of drug resistance genes into hematopoietic cells might allow the administration of higher doses of chemotherapy and, therefore, increase regression of chemosensitive tumors. In addition, this approach can be used to select in vivo transduced cells by their enrichment after administration of cytotoxic drugs. Our group has studied the potential value of MRP1 to protect hematopoietic cells. The interest in the use of MRP1 as an alternative to MDR1 gene transfer for bone marrow protection lies in its different modulation. Indeed, classical P-gp reversal agents, tested in clinic to decrease MDR1 tumor resistance, have little or no effect on MRP1 function. This would allow, in the same patient, the use of reversal agents to decrease P-gp tumor resistance without reversing bone marrow protection of the transduced hematopoietic cells provided by MRP1. We constructed two different MRP1-containing vectors with either the Harvey retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) as promoters and generated ecotropic producer cells. MRP1 transduced fibroblasts were more resistant to doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide and their chemoprotection was increased after selection with chemotherapeutic agents in the presence of glutathione, a co-factor for MRP1 function. Lethally irradiated mice were engrafted with bone marrow (BM) cells transduced with MRP1 vectors (PGK promoter). We demonstrated that high expression of MRP1 in murine hematopoietic cells reduces doxorubicin-induced leukopenia and mortality. In addition, in vivo selection of MRP1-transduced BM cells was achieved following doxorubicin administration and allowed a better chemoprotection after the second chemotherapy cycle.", "answer": "Transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with MRP1 genes provides protection from chemotherapy toxicity by enhancing the cells' ability to resist the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby reducing drug-induced damage and mortality.", "covered": false}

This study sought to evaluate the long-term prognostic significance of stress-redistribution-reinjection Tl-201 imaging in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and coronary artery bypass surgery. Preoperative stress-redistribution-reinjection Tl-201 imaging detects viable but asynergic segments which show functional improvement postoperatively and is considered as a valuable noninvasive method in selection of patients with severe LV dysfunction for revascularization. The long-term prognostic value of the reinjection technique remains unclear. Fifty-two patients with severe LV dysfunction (mean ejection fraction (EF) 0.32+/-0.03) who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in 1993-1994 were included in the study. Patients had follow-up 49+/-12 months. LV function was assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Perfusion was assessed by Tl-201 SPECT imaging and was graded on a four-point scale (0 = normal, 3 = absent uptake) using the 20 segment model. Perfusion index was derived by adding the score of all segments and dividing these by 20. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised patients with seven and more dysfunctional viable myocardial segments. Group B included patients with less than seven dysfunctional but viable segments. Mean EF increased from 0.32+/-0.03 to 0.46+/-0.04. Mean perfusion index did not show a significant difference as a whole during follow-up compared to the early postoperative values (0.9+/-0.4 and 1.1+/-0.4, p = NS). When adequacy of revascularization was considered, the predictive value of a positive preoperative viability test for functional improvement was 82%. Nineteen cardiac events occurred in group B patients and six in group A patients: six deaths (four from cardiac and two from noncardiac causes), 13 myocardial infarctions (MI). Multivariate Cox survival analysis identified the number of viable segments detected preoperatively (chi2 = 7.2, p = 0.002), postoperative improvement in Tl-uptake (chi2 = 6.6, p = 0.01) and functional improvement (chi2 = 5.3, p = 0.03) postoperatively as independent predictors of cardiac events.

This study adapted the laboratory bioassay for use in the field and deployed D. magna in situ at four known or suspected contaminated and reference sites. The bioassay was demonstrated to be reliable for use in the field because more than 90% of test organisms were recovered live from the test chambers after exposure allowing feeding rates to be measured after exposure. At each of the contaminated sites, significant depressions in postexposure feeding rates were recorded. Although depressions in postexposure feeding rates were apparent at all contaminated sites, with the exception of Langholm, no impacts were detected on the benthic macroinvertebrate community, when using the Biological Monitoring Working Party scoring system. This demonstrated that during this study, post-exposure feeding depression was a more reliable and sensitive endpoint to use to detect toxicity than were changes in community structure.

The goal of this study was to identify the relative toxicity of ambient areas in the Chesapeake Bay watershed by using a suite of concurrent water column and sediment toxicity tests at seventy-five ambient stations in 20 Chesapeake Bay rivers from 1990 through 1999. Spatial and temporal variability was examined at selected locations throughout the 10 yr study. Inorganic and organic contaminants were evaluated in ambient water and sediment concurrently with water column and sediment tests to assess possible causes of toxicity although absolute causality can not be established. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to develop a multiple endpoint toxicity index (TOX-INDEX) at each station for both water column and sediment toxicity data. Water column tests from the 10 yr testing period showed that 49% of the time, some degree of toxicity was reported. The most toxic sites based on water column results were located in urbanized areas such as the Anacostia River, Elizabeth River and the Middle River. Water quality criteria for copper, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc were exceeded at one or more of these sites. Water column toxicity was also reported in localized areas of the South and Chester Rivers. Both spatial and temporal variability was reported from the suite of water column toxicity tests. Some degree of sediment toxicity was reported from 62% of the tests conducted during the ten year period. The Elizabeth River and Baltimore Harbor stations were reported as the most toxic areas based on sediment results. Sediment toxicity guidelines were exceeded for one or more of the following metals at these two locations: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc. At the Elizabeth River stations nine of sixteen semi-volatile organics and two of seven pesticides measured exceeded the ER-M values in 1990. Ambient sediment toxicity tests in the Elizabeth River in 1996 showed reduced toxicity. Various semi-volatile organics exceeded the ER-M values at a number of Baltimore Harbor sites; pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene were particularly high at one of the stations (Northwest Harbor).

Gene transfer into hematopoietic cells is currently being used to modulate immune responses, to protect hematopoietic cells against cytotoxic drugs or viral genes, and to restore gene deficiencies due to either inborn genetic defects or acquired loss of regular gene function. In particular, gene addition strategies for inherited severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency or defects of the interleukin-2 receptor gamma-chain represent potentially curative strategies based on gene transfer into hematopoietic cells using recombinant retroviral vectors. Since long-term correction of genetic defects in hematopoietic cells often requires transduction of hematopoietic stem cells, an effective gene transfer into stem cells with efficient long-term and multi-lineage transgene expression is the desired goal for these therapeutic strategies. However, gene transfer strategies with retroviral vectors unable to integrate into non-cycling cells are limited by the quiescent state of the stem cells that have to be stimulated by cytokines to induce cell cycle progression. To circumvent these barriers, lentiviral vector systems based on HIV-1 have recently been developed which are able to deliver and express genes in non-dividing cells both in vitro and in vivo. This review outlines the development and improvement of lentivirus-based gene transfer protocols and discusses the use of lentiviral vectors in preclinical gene therapy studies.", "answer": "Lentiviral vectors can transduce non-dividing cells, unlike retroviral vectors which require cell division.", "covered": false}

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic, life-threatening hypermetabolic syndrome in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to certain anesthetic agents. Discovered by Denborough and Lovell [1] in 1960, MH was associated with high mortality and morbidity as the cause was unknown and an effective treatment was unavailable. There is no classic clinical presentation of the syndrome, and the onset and signs of MH are dependent upon known and unknown environmental and genetic factors. Initial theories involved central temperature regulation defects or uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [2], but later investigations targeted skeletal muscle as the affected organ. Subsequently freshly biopsied skeletal muscle was used for in vitro pharmacologic contracture testing to discriminate between normal and MH-affected muscle and remains the \"gold standard\" for MH diagnosis. Spontaneous, genetic models for MH were discovered in pigs and dogs and substantial knowledge about MH was gained from these valuable resources. The abnormal contracture response of MH skeletal muscle evoked a focus on calcium regulation, and abnormalities in calcium release (as opposed to calcium sequestration) mechanisms were discovered. About this same time the major calcium release channel in the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane was purified and named the ryanodine receptor [3]. Although the ryanodine receptor represents one of the largest functional proteins, the enormous gene encoding the 5021 amino acids comprising the ryanodine receptor subunit was eventually cloned [4,5]. Patient and dedicated work on the ryanodine receptor gene has found linkage to MH in the pig [6], dog [7], and among several different mutations and MH in unrelated human families [8,9]. Expression of these mutations in HEK cells has resulted in abnormal calcium release [10,11], supporting but not proving a causal basis for MH. In this review each of the areas mentioned above is discussed in detail revealing a wonderful success story that changed the anesthesiologist's \"worst nightmare\" from a syndrome with high mortality and morbidity to a reasonably well managed disease today.

Long-term dissolution from diesel fuel into the aqueous phase was determined experimentally in a continuous flow-through system using the slow-stirring method. The data obtained are interpreted using a dynamic equilibrium dissolution model based on Raoult's law. The predicted temporal development of aqueous concentrations are in good agreement with the experimental results. When a compound in the NAPL approaches complete depletion, a tailing behavior is observed, which is assigned to nonequilibrium effects, such as mass transfer limitations in the NAPL phase. The model predicted an increase of the mean molar mass of the diesel fuel of 1.5% over the entire experimental period.

When using these amines as eluents, the peak resolution between these mono- and divalent cations was not quite satisfactory and the peak shapes of NH4+ and K+ were largely destroyed on the SMBSG B-5 silica gel column. Hence, the application of SMBSG B-5 silica gel calcinated at 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C for 5 h in the IC-IPD was carried out.

However, there is some scattering both in cell length at birth (BL) and in cycle time (CT). By computational simulations we show here that this scattering cannot be explained solely by asymmetric cell division, therefore we assume that nuclear division is a stochastic, asymmetric process as well. We introduce an appropriate stochastic variable into a mathematical model and prove that this assumption is suitable to describe the CT vs. BL graph in a wild-type fission yeast population. In a double mutant of fission yeast (namely wee1-50 cdc25 delta) this CT vs. BL plot is even more curious: cycle time splits into three different values resulting in three clusters in this coordinate system.

In this study, we assessed the effects of anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and IL-12 in lethally irradiated mice. Acute lethal toxicity was observed following the administration of either 10 microg anti-CD40 MoAb (FGK45) or 0.5 microg of recombinant murine (rm)IL-12 that resulted in 100% mortality of all mice within 4 to 6 days.

However, the process was not demonstrated on a large scale to prove its practical application. We investigated the scale-up of a spinning-disk MBD generator for the aerobic fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). A 1-L spinning-disk MBD generator was used to supply air for 1- and 50-L working volume fermentation of baker's yeast. For the two levels investigated, the MBD generator maintained an adequate supply of surfactant-stabilized air microbubbles to the microorganisms at a relatively low agitation rate (150 rpm). There was a significant improvement in oxygen transfer to the microorganism relative to the conventional sparger. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa, for the MBD system at 150 rpm was 765 h(-1) compared to 937 h(-1) for the conventional sparger at 500 rpm. It is plausible to surmise that fermentation using larger working volumes may further improve the kLa values and the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels because of longer hold-up times and, consequently, improve cell growth. There was no statistically significant difference between the cell mass yield on substrate (0.43 g/g) under the MBD regime at an agitation rate of 150 rpm and that achieved for the conventional air-sparged system (0.53 g/g) at an agitation rate of 500 rpm.

Enhancement of dermal and epidermal regeneration represents a crucial goal for the treatment of acute, e.g. burn and trauma wounds, and chronic wounds, e.g. diabetic, autoimmune, arterial and venous wounds. Studies defining molecular mechanisms of the complex cascade of wound healing have shown that growth factors represent a new therapeutic strategy. The clinical application of growth factors in the form of proteins has been shown to be of little benefit. Therefore new delivery systems and therapeutic strategies needed to be developed to improve dermal and epidermal regeneration, one of which is gene therapy. For successful gene delivery the selection of an appropriate vector has been shown to be paramount. Because Retroviruses, Adenoviruses and Adeno-Associated Viruses can cause immunologic reactions and mutations, non-viral delivery systems for gene therapy, such as liposomal gene transfer appear advantageous over viral gene therapy.

We investigated whether the calcein/Co2+-quenching technique introduced by Petronilli et al. [Biofactors 8 (1998) 263], which allows direct observation of PTP opening, can be applied to neurons. Exposure of calcein-loaded neurons to Co2+ ions resulted in the fading of diffuse cytoplasmic calcein fluorescence, with organelle-restricted fluorescent spots remaining. These spots were colocalized with mitochondrially-entrapped tetramethylrhodamineethylester (TMRE) fluorescence and corresponded to colocalization of calcein and TMRE fluorescence in digitonin-permeabilized neurons.

Because the frequency of bacteriuria in men after prostatectomy was also lower than that after orthotopic bladder substitution (see Table 1), removal of the prostate and any of its presumed antibacterial properties probably does not account for this difference. Furthermore, the authors' data (see Table 5 ) and that of Woodside and associates [23] demonstrate that intestine incorporated into the genitourinary tract generates a local antibody response against urinary bacteria. Although others have suggested that the incorporation of bowel in the urinary tract may be associated with increased bacteriuria, this effect has never been documented prospectively. The mechanism of this increased frequency of bacteriuria is unknown. Because the anatomy of the male secretory genitourinary system may be altered after radical prostatectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution, the authors evaluated local antibody production before and after these operations. More than 20 years ago, Burdon [5] found that the initial portion of the VB1 sample in men had significantly higher levels of IgA compared with the VB2 specimen, whereas the levels of IgG were similar in the two portions. This latter finding was confirmed by Shorliffe and co-workers [22] when they examined prostatic secretion. Other investigators have found high levels of IgA in human prostatic tissue and fluid. [24,25]. On the basis of these findings, it was believed that, in men, the prostate produces most of the urinary IgA, whereas the bladder or upper urinary tracts make most of the urinary IgG. Although the authors' study confirms that most local urinary tract IgG is produced by the bladder or upper urinary tracts, this study documents that the prostate is not the only source of urethral IgA in men. Despite almost complete removal or prostate secretory epithelium by radical prostatectomy, as evidenced by a dramatic fall in postoperative VB1 and VB2 PSA compared with preoperative levels (Table 3). men who had this operation had only slightly decreased IgA levels after the operation (Table 4, Fig I). The source of this IgA must be urethral because the VB1 urinary stream contains more IgA than the VB2 urine even after radical prostatectomy. The authors have not determined whether the urinary IgA concentrations observed after radical prostatectomy are the true baseline values for a man without a prostate, or whether they actually reflect abnormal production of local IgA stimulated by radical prostatectomy. Because post-prostatectomy bacteriuris occurred frequently during urethral catheter drainage, the authors screened for postoperative IgA titers to mix 1 and mix 2 to determine whether specific production of antibody against gram-negative organisms might account for some of the postoperative IgA measured. Postradical prostatectomy mix 1 and mix 2 titers were not elevated, compared with preoperative measurements. Because urethral glandular tissue other than prostatic tissue is present in the male urethra, these glands also might be responsible for significant local antibody production. The high levels of urinary IgA and IgG after cystoprostatectomy with ileal orthotopic bladder substitution document that intestine incorporated into the urinary tract is still capable of producing local antibody. This observation corresponds with the findings of Mansson and associated [26] of elevated IgA and IgG in ileal reservoir urine compared with normal urinary tracts. It has been estimated that 1 m of intestine may secrete up to 780 mg/d of IgA [27], indicating that normal intestine production of antibody alone can account for the high IgA and IgG levels found in the patients who underwent bladder substitution. Interestingly, the ratio of IgA to IgG concentration in smal intestine fluid is 2:129, similar to the ratio of IgA to IgG in bladder substitution urine (2.92.1:52, Table 4). Because mix 1 and mix 2 IgA concentrations were elevated in VB1 and VB2 urine after ileal bladder substitution (see Table 5), some of this antibody was produced by the ileal bladder substitution in response to the inevitable bacteriuria that occurs during the prolonged postoperative catheter drainage. The findings is absent after radical prostatectomy alone. In addition, some of this increased antibody might be a result of the increased bacteriuria noted in the patients who underwent ileal bladder substitution after the initial postoperative period. The significance of the increased bacteriuria and elevated antibody levels after ileal bladder substitution is unclear. Because most of these episodes of bacteriuria were asymptomatic, whether they represent clinical infections that should be treated is not known. Bishop and associates [28] found that the bacterial flora of ileal conduits with asymptomatic bacteriuria had bacterial counts of 1000 or fewer colonies, and they noted that the healthy ileum in situ may contain more than 10,000 organisms per milliliter [29]. Because the normal urinary tract is usually sterile, it is possible that the bacteriuria found by the authors after ileal bladder substitution represents some form of bowel colonization more commonly associated with the bowel rather than clinical urinary tract infection and has limited clinial importance. Trinchieri and associated [30] found that urinary from patients with ileocystoplasty prevented attachment of E. coli to human uroepithelial cells more effectively that urine from patients with recurrent urinary infections. This observation suggests that the relatively large quantities of Iga produced by the ileal bladder substitution may, in fact, prevent clinical infection by preventing tissue invasion by the bacteria. Only long-term follow-up of patients with ileocystoplasty or ileal bladder substitution will determine the clinical significance of the bacteriuria. The authors' study had documented an increased incidence of bacteriuria in men after ileal bladder substitution and no such increase after radical prostatectomy. Analysis of the data shows that male sources other than the prostate--probably urethral glands-- must produce significant quantities of local urinary tract IgA. After ileal bladder substitution, the incorporated ileum may produce volumes of local antibody that may exceed the amounts ordinarily produce by the normal urinary tract. The clinical significance of the increased incidence of bacteriuria and elevated antibody levels in patients after illeal bladder substitution is unclear.", "answer": "Unclear", "covered": false}

The aim of this randomized, open clinical trial was to evaluate eNO in relation to conventional lung function parameters at rest and after exercise during sequential changes of inhaled steroids in children with persistent asthma. The study consisted of a 4 week run-in period, a 4 week washout phase and a randomized treatment period during which only one group was treated again with inhaled budesonide. After run-in, eNO was reduced to normal values, and rose again during washout. In the patients randomized to steroid treatment, eNO was again decreased, whereas it remained unchanged in the untreated patients. Forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity at rest and after exercise improved significantly after run-in, but showed no difference after randomization. However there was a strong correlation of eNO with patient compliance. Exhaled nitric oxide was able to differentiate between children briefly treated with or without steroids, the conventional lung-function variables however could not. In practice exhaled nitric oxide may thus be a valuable parameter to monitor adherence to steroids, but less suitable to describe physiologically relevant impairments of lung function.", "answer": "Decreased in treated patients, unchanged in untreated patients.", "covered": false}

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) infects upwards of four million people in the US each year, of which 20% require subsequent hospitalisation. Consequently, it is a large contributor to excessive healthcare resource consumption and cost. Since the aetiology of CAP is not identified in a majority of patients, treatment is often empiric, aimed at the most common causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and the atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila). A variety of pharmaceutical agents exist for the treatment of CAP, most notably the cephalosporin and penicillin derivatives, the macrolide/azalide antibacterials, the newer tetracyclines, and most recently the respiratory fluoroquinolones. Choosing an agent is usually related to issues such as patient compliance, adverse event profiles, and the presence of resistance. Of these, resistance seems to be the main factor today. S. pneumoniae, the most common cause of CAP, is steadily acquiring resistance to a majority of the currently available antibacterials, thus further increasing costs due to prolonged hospitalisation, treatment of relapses and the use of more expensive antibacterials. Understanding and maximising the pharmacodynamic properties of the available antibacterials will not only prevent the emergence of resistance, thus prolonging their clinical utility, but also reduce the costs associated with treating the infection through rapid symptom improvement and earlier patient discharge. Numerous methods for reducing costs in patients with bacterial infections are documented in the literature and can be applied to CAP. Choosing monotherapy instead of combination therapy can reduce costs associated with the administration of the antibacterial. Agents with longer half-lives allow for once-daily administration, which in turn, leads to improved compliance, successful outcomes, and decreased costs. Administering antibacterials to maximise their pharmacodynamics, such as with continuous infusion of beta-lactams, reduces the amount of drug needed in addition to savings associated with administration and supplies. Finally, transitioning patients to oral therapy as soon as they are clinically stable can significantly reduce the length of hospital stay, which is the major contributing factor of healthcare costs. The use of a clinical pathway in an institution is the most effective way to apply these cost-saving approaches in the treatment of CAP. These pathways should be specific to each institution, thus considering the resistance rates in the area and encouraging the use of the most active, cost-effective agents to produce rapid, positive clinical outcomes.", "answer": "Significantly reduces.", "covered": false}

Dorsal carpal osteochondral injury is a major cause of lameness in horses undergoing high intensity training. Intra-articular corticosteroid treatment is used commonly to manage exercise-associated articular pain, but its use remains highly controversial in the equine athlete. This project, therefore, aimed to compare the mechanical properties of intra-articular MPA and diluent-treated middle carpal subchondral and cancellous bone in horses undergoing a short-term treadmill exercise programme. It was hypothesised that subchondral and cancellous bone mechanical properties are influenced by intra-articular administration of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA). Eight 2-year-old female horses had MPA or diluent administered into contralateral middle carpal joints at 14 day intervals, for a total of 4 treatments per horse. Horses underwent a standard treadmill exercise protocol until euthanasia (Day 70). Standard sites were located on the dorsal aspect of third, radial and intermediate carpal bones. Osteochondral samples from each test site were divided into subchondral bone and cancellous bone portions. These were dried, resin-embedded and gold-coated. Microhardness measurements were obtained at each test site. No significant effect of intra-articular treatment was detected. At each site, cancellous bone trabecular struts had an 18-19% higher microhardness value than the overlying subchondral bone. These findings indicate that intra-articular administration of MPA at this dose has no effect on subchondral or cancellous bone adaptation to short-term exercise and, therefore, on the propensity of carpal bones to injury.

Aim of the study was to examine if the addition of buffering sodiumhydrogenphosphate to poly(D,L)lactide(PDLLA) would stabilize the pH-value in the in vivo environment of implanted material and whether this improves its biocompatibility. The material was predegraded just to the point of viscous disintegration to test the PDLLA in the moment of its most aggressive effect on the surrounding tissue. Racemic amorphous PDLLA was injection-molded with or without the admixture of 1 mol NaP per 100 mol lactate, the degradation product of PDLLA (=1 mol%) to form 20mm x 3 mm x 2mm rods. Predegradation was performed by storing the rods at 55 degrees C for 14 days, just to the point of beginning dissolution. Predegraded PDLLA or PDLLA + NaP samples were used for in vitro incubation tests, as well as for the in vivo study, where the rods were implanted into the spinal muscles of 30 male Wistar rats. Repeatedly, measurements of the pH-value were made in the incubation solutions in vitro. The surrounding tissue of the implanted samples as well as the normal contralateral muscle tissue was checked for its pH-value in a group of 3 rats, respectively, anaesthesized at various time intervals after implantation. After these measurements the implants and their surrounding tissues were excised for histological examination. In Ringer's solution pH-values dropped immediately within the first week of incubation of both predegraded materials reaching -4 pH units after 4 weeks in the PDLLA containing medium, after 6 weeks in the PDLLA + NaP containing medium. Soerensen buffer slowed the pH decrease with significant differences between the material groups up to the 28th week.

Oral reconstructions for cleft palate repair are often complicated by a shortage of mucosal tissue. This shortage causes scar tissue formation leading to impaired growth of the dento-maxillary complex. The overall aim of our research is to develop a substitute. which limits the iatrogenic effects of cleft palate surgery. This study describes the culture and characterization of mucosal substitutes containing keratinocytes. Epidermal and oral keratinocytes from a beagle dog were cultured on several skin-derived and collagen-based substrates. Oral keratinocytes cultured on the skin-derived substrates closely resembled normal oral epithelium of the dog. A multi-layered epithelium was formed showing parakeratosis, expression of cytokeratin 16 and the formation of a basement membrane. Epidermal keratinocytes cultured on the skin-derived substrates formed an epithelium which was similar to dog epidermis. In contrast, keratinocytes cultured on the collagen-based substrates invaded the substrate without the formation of a multi-layered epithelium. In conclusion, this study shows that oral canine keratinocytes cultured on skin-derived substrates exhibit a tissue organization that resembles normal oral mucosa. This type of mucosal substitute will therefore be used in further studies for implantation on the palate of beagle dogs. These studies might eventually lead to an improvement of cleft palate surgery in humans.", "answer": "Develop a mucosal substitute that limits the iatrogenic effects of cleft palate surgery.", "covered": false}

Over the last few decades, there have been considerable improvements in the outcome of stroke patients both as regards mortality and disability. At least some of these improvements can be attributed to better organization of services and improved rehabilitation. Many patients, however, remain severely disabled and we will need to develop new strategies in which the focus will be on reversing impairments rather than simply helping patients to adapt to unaltered impairments. For this to happen, neurological rehabilitation research will have to develop therapies that have a clearly defined rationale and are rooted in neurosciences, are clinically described, are addressed to a well-characterized target population and are evaluated using appropriate outcome measures. Few studies at present meet all these criteria. The recent revolution in our understanding of the nervous system as being soft-wired, of the potential for recovery through reorganization and of the central role of afferent information associated with normal activity is ground for optimism and indicates the direction in which future therapies should be sought. The paper considers some approaches to providing appropriate afferent information, including inputs such as that from electrotherapy, novel approaches to assisted activity and constraint-induced therapy. We are on the verge of a revolution in neurological rehabilitation. If we exploit the new understanding of the nervous system arising from basic neurosciences in developing and evaluating therapies we should be able to build on the achievements of the last few decades so that fewer of our patients have to carry the burden of severe disability.", "answer": "Improved organization of services and rehabilitation have significantly enhanced outcomes for stroke patients by reducing mortality and disability, though challenges remain in addressing severe disabilities.", "covered": false}

Cardiac arrest in children outside the hospital is associated with high mortality rates. Recent investigations have suggested that the use of advanced life support (ALS) measures by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel may decrease survival. These studies have used the pediatric Utstein style of defining ALS and basic life support (BLS) measures. The pediatric Utstein style defines BLS as \"an attempt to restore effective ventilation and circulation\" using noninvasive means to open the airway but specifically excludes the use of bag-valve-mask devices. Advanced life support is defined as the \"addition of invasive maneuvers to restore effective ventilation and circulation.\" The authors of the study described below believe that using this definition would categorize some patients into an ALS group who would otherwise be categorized as having received BLS (i.e., \"bag-valve-mask only\"). To compare survival rates among children receiving BLS or ALS following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using amended definitions of prehospital life support measures. Specifically, the definition of BLS was expanded to include the use of bag-valve-mask devices only. This was a retrospective chart review in an urban, pediatric emergency department. Patients included all children presenting to the emergency department between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1999, following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Twenty-one patients were excluded from further analysis because of absent or incomplete medical records. One hundred eighty-nine patients were studied. Five children (2.6%) survived to discharge from the hospital. Of 189 children, 39 (20.6%) were provided BLS measures by prehospital personnel; 150 (79.4%) received ALS.

It is important to perform genetic quality control on inbred mouse strains to minimize variability of genetic backgrounds. We used sensitive molecular methods to examine the genetic integrity of inbred mouse substrains maintained at an academic institution. Our goal, in part, was to compare the different molecular genetic monitoring methods to determine which were most sensitive, efficient, and beneficial in our genetic monitoring program. We examined the sensitivity and efficiency of simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) analysis of microsatellites and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of minisatellites with commercial, human, and synthetic mouse minisatellite probes. Although no polymorphisms were detected with the microsatellite analysis, certain minisatellite probes detected a small degree of polymorphism between our mouse substrains and the commercially available strains used as controls. Minisatellite probes also detected intra-substrain variation within our colonies; this variation probably represents mutations in highly unstable loci rather than genetic variation. Our analysis indicated that the genetic integrity of in-house C57BL/Ka, BALB/cKa, and C3H/Km inbred substrains had remained intact over 35 generations. Genetic monitoring by RFLP minisatellite analysis was more sensitive and efficient in detecting substrain differences than was SSLP microsatellite analysis.

Fifty-two patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery participated in this study. Cellular DNA content and mitotic index (MI) in tissue samples were measured before and after chemotherapy, using a cell image analyzer. A decrease in both mean DNA content (mean DNA) and MI (left-shift type of change in cell growth kinetics), indicating an accumulation of cancer cells in the G0-G1 phase, was found in 25 patients. An increase in mean DNA with decreased MI (right-shift type), which was found in 13 patients, appeared to be correlated with an accumulation of cancer cells in the S-G2 phase. Neither of these two types of change, which were considered to be a favorable effect, were found in 14 patients (ineffective type).

In recent years generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has become a much better defined disorder, with specific criteria distinguishing it from the other anxiety disorders; however, it still lacks the same public and scientific interests as some of the other anxiety disorders such as panic and social phobia. Nevertheless, refinement in the treatment of GAD is becoming more evident through the conduct of clinical trials. Up until the mid-1980's, treatment consisted primarily of benzodiazepines. However, as a result of growing characterisation of their abuse potential, other therapeutic options were explored. Benzodiazepines became seen as an effective short-term therapy, and buspirone and some of the newer antidepressants have become the treatment of choice for patients with GAD requiring long-term treatment. Buspirone was the first available alternative to the benzodiazepines in the US; however, the initial excitement over this agent was somewhat dampened because of its mild efficacy combined with a slow onset of action. The antidepressants were seen as beneficial for the treatment of GAD because of the high comorbidity with depression, thus allowing a better outcome for these patients. The antidepressants that offer both a good adverse effect profile and efficacy are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including paroxetine, and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine. Clinicians should also consider the potential benefits of psychotherapy as an adjunct to medication.

Several new drugs have become available for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These agents include selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, leflunomide and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists. COX-2 inhibitors have a more favourable gastrointestinal adverse effect profile than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the COX-2 inhibitors are also associated with hypertension, oedema and congestive heart failure, the well-known adverse effects of conventional NSAIDs. Patients with treated hypertension should be monitored regularly when conventional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors are administered. At present, there is a considerable debate regarding the risk of cardiovascular events with the COX-2 inhibitors. The available literature gives no unequivocal answers. This matter can only be solved by an appropriate trial assessing the cardiovascular risk of these agents. Patients with RA appear to have an enhanced cardiovascular risk which might be related to an unfavourable lipid profile. Corticosteroids induce hypercholesterolaemia in patients other than those with RA. It was recently shown that total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were low in patients with RA who had a high disease activity. Contrary to the expectation, combination therapy with prednisolone rapidly improved the atherogenic index (total/HDL cholesterol). Ongoing studies investigating this topic are underway. It is not known to what extent corticosteroids induce hypertension in patients with RA. Hence, we advocate blood pressure control for these patients. A small percentage of patients with RA develop hypertension when taking leflunomide, and no other serious cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported in the literature. Blood pressure monitoring is recommended especially in the first months of treatment. TNFalpha antagonists are contraindicated in patients with RA who have congestive heart failure. No specific cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported with the use of these agents in the non-cardiovascular compromised patient. TNFalpha antagonists are the most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs presently available. As inflammation plays an important role in RA as well as in cardiovascular disease and, in view of the increased cardiovascular risk in RA, it is tempting to expect that suppression of inflammation ultimately will lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with RA.", "answer": "Hypertension, edema, and congestive heart failure.", "covered": false}

In current practice, the planning volume for adjuvant brachytherapy treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma is either not determined a priori (in this case, seed locations are selected based on isodose curves conforming to a visual estimate of the planning volume), or it is derived via a tedious manual process. In either case, the process is subjective and time consuming, and is highly dependent on the human planner. The focus of the work described herein involves the development of an automated contouring algorithm to outline the planning volume. Such an automatic procedure will save time and provide a consistent and objective method for determining planning volumes. In addition, a definitive representation of the planning volume will allow for sophisticated brachytherapy treatment planning approaches to be applied when designing treatment plans, so as to maximize local tumour control and minimize normal tissue complications. An automated tumour volume contouring algorithm is developed utilizing computational geometry and numerical interpolation techniques in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method. The target volume is defined to be the slab of tissue r cm perpendicularly away from the curvilinear plane defined by the mesh of catheters. We assume that if adjacent catheters are over 2r cm apart, the tissue between the two catheters is part of the tumour bed. Input data consist of the digitized coordinates of the catheter positions in each of several cross-sectional slices of the tumour bed, and the estimated distance r from the catheters to the tumour surface. Mathematically, one can view the planning volume as the volume enclosed within a minimal smoothly-connected surface which contains a set of circles, each circle centred at a given catheter position in a given cross-sectional slice. The algorithm performs local interpolation on consecutive triplets of circles. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated based on its performance on a collection of soft-tissue sarcoma tumour beds within various anatomical structures. For each of 15 patient cases considered, the algorithm takes approximately 2 min to generate the planning volume. Although the tumour shapes are rather different, the algorithm consistently generates planning volumes that visually demonstrate smooth curves compactly encapsulating the circles. This general-purpose contouring algorithm works well whether the catheters are all close together, spread far apart in the plane or arranged in a convoluted way. The automatic contouring algorithm significantly reduces labour time and provides a consistent and objective method for determining planning volumes for soft-tissue sarcoma. Further studies are needed to validate the significance of the resulting planning volumes in designing treatment plans and the role that sophisticated brachytherapy treatment planning optimization may have in producing good plans.", "answer": "Computational geometry, numerical interpolation techniques, and artificial intelligence.", "covered": false}

Hypocalcemia occurs due to decreased production of active vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D), responsible for gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of calcium and phosphorus and suppression of parathyroid hormone excretion. Hyperphosphatemia occurs because of impaired phosphate excretion in the setting of renal failure. Both hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia stimulate hypertrophy of the parathyroid gland and increase the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common viral infection of squamous epithelial tissues, but its importance has only recently been recognised by the medical community. HPVs are now realised to consist of many genotypes and are associated with a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations. Within the genital tract, some diseases have been recognised since antiquity; for example, genital warts which are caused by HPV types distinct from those causing genital cancer. However, others (such as cervical cancer), although recognised centuries ago as linked to sexual activity, have only been associated with oncogenic HPVs relatively recently, with the tools of molecular biology. We now understand that genital HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted viral infections, are largely transient, asymptomatic and of no consequence. This virus manifests as more than just benign warts. Chronic carriage of with oncogenic genotypes (over years and in a minority of patients), together with other cofactors (host and/or exogenous) in complex pathways not totally understood, result in severe dysplasia or, ultimately, carcinogenesis. As it takes time for precursor lesions to develop and there are effective screening programmes for their detection and treatment, HPV-related neoplastic disease of the cervix is largely a preventable reproductive health issue of women. Yet, on a global scale, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of women, with the majority of cases occurring in developing countries. Although HPV is noncultivatable by traditional diagnostic virological methods, successfully applied molecular biology techniques have underpinned development of vaccines which are now in phase II/III clinical trials.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic, life-threatening hypermetabolic syndrome in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to certain anesthetic agents. Discovered by Denborough and Lovell [1] in 1960, MH was associated with high mortality and morbidity as the cause was unknown and an effective treatment was unavailable. There is no classic clinical presentation of the syndrome, and the onset and signs of MH are dependent upon known and unknown environmental and genetic factors. Initial theories involved central temperature regulation defects or uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [2], but later investigations targeted skeletal muscle as the affected organ. Subsequently freshly biopsied skeletal muscle was used for in vitro pharmacologic contracture testing to discriminate between normal and MH-affected muscle and remains the \"gold standard\" for MH diagnosis. Spontaneous, genetic models for MH were discovered in pigs and dogs and substantial knowledge about MH was gained from these valuable resources. The abnormal contracture response of MH skeletal muscle evoked a focus on calcium regulation, and abnormalities in calcium release (as opposed to calcium sequestration) mechanisms were discovered. About this same time the major calcium release channel in the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane was purified and named the ryanodine receptor [3]. Although the ryanodine receptor represents one of the largest functional proteins, the enormous gene encoding the 5021 amino acids comprising the ryanodine receptor subunit was eventually cloned [4,5]. Patient and dedicated work on the ryanodine receptor gene has found linkage to MH in the pig [6], dog [7], and among several different mutations and MH in unrelated human families [8,9]. Expression of these mutations in HEK cells has resulted in abnormal calcium release [10,11], supporting but not proving a causal basis for MH. In this review each of the areas mentioned above is discussed in detail revealing a wonderful success story that changed the anesthesiologist's \"worst nightmare\" from a syndrome with high mortality and morbidity to a reasonably well managed disease today. This success story includes unraveling the molecular basis for the disease and brings its pathoetiologic and diagnostic aspects toward molecular genetic resolution.", "answer": "1960", "covered": false}

Spinal nerves originate from the spinal cord at increasingly oblique angles from vertebrae CI to Co, and the nerve roots pass in the vertebral canal for increasingly longer distances. Their spinal cord level of origin therefore becomes increasingly dissociated from their vertebral column level of exit. This is particularly evident for lumbar and sacral spinal nerves.

The effects of gold-chloroquine derivatives with the formula [Au(PR3)(CQ)]PF6 (where R = Ph (1), Et or Me) on the superoxide anion production by human neutrophils (PMNs, polymorphonuclear cells) were investigated. When these complexes (0.1-3 mumol/l) were added to PMNs prior to the activators formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), they inhibited isoluminol-horseradish peroxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (CLisol). The inhibition was a direct result of effects on PMNs since chemiluminescence in the cell-free system (horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxidase-isoluminol) was not affected. The above mentioned concentrations of the complexes did not show in vitro toxicity on the cells. On the other hand, when 1 mumol/l of complex 1 was added to cells after stimulation, the chemiluminescence of PMNs stimulated by PMA was inhibited, but not the chemiluminescence stimulated by fMLP. The gold-chloroquine binding was essential for the referred activity as chemiluminescence was not influenced by the precursors chloroquine (CAS 54-05-7) and AuCl(PPh3). Furthermore, the extent of inhibition of chemiluminescence in PMNs activated by PMA did not increase with the duration of preincubation in presence of 1 mumol/l of 1.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) infects upwards of four million people in the US each year, of which 20% require subsequent hospitalisation. Consequently, it is a large contributor to excessive healthcare resource consumption and cost. Since the aetiology of CAP is not identified in a majority of patients, treatment is often empiric, aimed at the most common causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and the atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila). A variety of pharmaceutical agents exist for the treatment of CAP, most notably the cephalosporin and penicillin derivatives, the macrolide/azalide antibacterials, the newer tetracyclines, and most recently the respiratory fluoroquinolones. Choosing an agent is usually related to issues such as patient compliance, adverse event profiles, and the presence of resistance. Of these, resistance seems to be the main factor today. S. pneumoniae, the most common cause of CAP, is steadily acquiring resistance to a majority of the currently available antibacterials, thus further increasing costs due to prolonged hospitalisation, treatment of relapses and the use of more expensive antibacterials. Understanding and maximising the pharmacodynamic properties of the available antibacterials will not only prevent the emergence of resistance, thus prolonging their clinical utility, but also reduce the costs associated with treating the infection through rapid symptom improvement and earlier patient discharge. Numerous methods for reducing costs in patients with bacterial infections are documented in the literature and can be applied to CAP. Choosing monotherapy instead of combination therapy can reduce costs associated with the administration of the antibacterial. Agents with longer half-lives allow for once-daily administration, which in turn, leads to improved compliance, successful outcomes, and decreased costs. Administering antibacterials to maximise their pharmacodynamics, such as with continuous infusion of beta-lactams, reduces the amount of drug needed in addition to savings associated with administration and supplies. Finally, transitioning patients to oral therapy as soon as they are clinically stable can significantly reduce the length of hospital stay, which is the major contributing factor of healthcare costs. The use of a clinical pathway in an institution is the most effective way to apply these cost-saving approaches in the treatment of CAP. These pathways should be specific to each institution, thus considering the resistance rates in the area and encouraging the use of the most active, cost-effective agents to produce rapid, positive clinical outcomes.", "answer": "Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila.", "covered": false}

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common viral infection of squamous epithelial tissues, but its importance has only recently been recognised by the medical community. HPVs are now realised to consist of many genotypes and are associated with a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations. Within the genital tract, some diseases have been recognised since antiquity; for example, genital warts which are caused by HPV types distinct from those causing genital cancer. However, others (such as cervical cancer), although recognised centuries ago as linked to sexual activity, have only been associated with oncogenic HPVs relatively recently, with the tools of molecular biology. We now understand that genital HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted viral infections, are largely transient, asymptomatic and of no consequence. This virus manifests as more than just benign warts. Chronic carriage of with oncogenic genotypes (over years and in a minority of patients), together with other cofactors (host and/or exogenous) in complex pathways not totally understood, result in severe dysplasia or, ultimately, carcinogenesis. As it takes time for precursor lesions to develop and there are effective screening programmes for their detection and treatment, HPV-related neoplastic disease of the cervix is largely a preventable reproductive health issue of women. Yet, on a global scale, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of women, with the majority of cases occurring in developing countries. Although HPV is noncultivatable by traditional diagnostic virological methods, successfully applied molecular biology techniques have underpinned development of vaccines which are now in phase II/III clinical trials. Successful vaccination ultimately has the greatest potential to impact upon the global burden of disease from genital HPV infection. However, the outcome from reduction in incidence of dysplasia and neoplasia will take years to eventuate; consequently, various cervical cancer prevention strategies still need to be endorsed and maintained in the meantime.", "answer": "Genital warts and cervical cancer.", "covered": false}

Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Gastric carcinogenesis is multifactorial. Although some environmental factors, such as excessive intake of salt and N-nitroso compounds in foods, are involved in this process, Helicobacter pylori has been closely linked to an increased risk of the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The IARC/WHO in 1994 concluded that H. pylori is a definite carcinogen in humans based on seroepidemiological evidence. H. pylori infection is associated with both intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer. Strong evidence has accumulated that H. pylori infection has been active in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma in the Mongolian gerbil (MG) model after long term infection and with or without treatment using low-dose chemical carcinogens. There are several criticisms of these reports. The most troublesome issue is the diagnostic criteria for gastric cancer in MGs, especially for well-differentiated cancers induced by H. pylori infection. Hence, common criteria for the diagnosis of gastric cancer in MGs is required. Another scientific approach is to find genetic-evidence to confirm the diagnosis.

The wire then passes through the subclavian vein, the brachiocephalic vein, the superior vena cava, and the right atrium, and lies on the wall of the right ventricle (where it can stimulate the heart to contract) (eFig. 3.118). If the wire pierces the axillary vein directly adjacent to the subclavius muscle, it is possible that after many years of shoulder movement the subclavius muscle stresses and breaks the wire, causing the pacemaker to fail.

Non-medullary thyroid carcinomas arise from follicular cells. The purpose of this study is to correlate clinical and pathological properties of these tumours with the rate of distant metastasis from a series of thyroid tumours excised at one institution. A total of 311 non-medullary thyroid tumours were identified and divided into: 29 follicular carcinoma (FC), 12 Hürthle cell carcinoma (HC), 13 Hürthle cell papillary thyroid carcinoma (HPTC) with vascular invasion (VI), 32 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with VI and 225 PTC without VI. The mean follow-up was 6.5 years with a range of 1-17 years. The tumours were histologically subdivided into minimal or wide invasion for FC and HC and focal or extensive invasion for PTC and HPTC, and stratified according to status of VI. The rate of distant metastasis was similar for FC, malignant Hürthle cell tumours and PTC with VI, and increased with extent of invasion. VI was seen in 12% of all PTC and 0% of HPTC in this study. PTC without VI were associated with a much lower potential of distant metastasis, were smaller in size and occurred in patients of younger age than PTC with VI. In addition, there was a tendency for increased potential for distant metastases with increased tumour size and patient age for all groups of tumours in the study. Patient age and tumour size appeared to play a smaller role than that of VI in predicting distant metastasis. Our study suggests that the rate of distant metastasis relates to VI, patient age and tumour size, regardless of Hürthle cell, FC or PTC differentiation. PTC of large size, and in patients older than 45 years, have a high propensity for vascular invasion.", "answer": "Lower", "covered": false}

Low bone density and large muscle mass predispose rabbits to femoral fractures. However, there are few reports describing treatment and prognosis. Two New Zealand White rabbits presented with unilateral left rear limb abduction and lateral rotation of the distal left rear limb 2 and 17 days after experimental surgery to create a \"stair step\" in the patellar groove of the left medial femoral chondyle. This procedure was performed after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Radiography revealed a spiral oblique mid-shaft fracture of the left femur in both rabbits. Open fracture reduction was undertaken. Because of the presence of screws and Kirschner-wires in the medial femoral condyle, a lateral approach to surgical correction was chosen. Intramedullary fixation was used to reduce and stabilize the fractures. A 0.062\" Kirschner wire was selected for the intramedullary device, because it was sufficiently flexible to allow easy passage into the femoral canal while being sufficiently stiff to promote reduction of the fracture. In addition, the ends of the fracture were secured with a 0.032\" Kirschner cerclage wire to provide additional control of rotation and angulation. Then we assessed the range of motion of the knee joint to determine fracture stability and ensure that the hardware did not impinge on soft-tissue elements. After closure and application of sterile dressing, the hind legs were hobbled proximal to the hock by using elastic veterinary wrap in a figure-eight pattern to maintain limb alignment and prevent formation of pressure ulcers. Intraoperative fluoroscopic evaluation and postoperative radiographs confirmed fracture reduction. Bruising and seroma formation occurred at the surgical site, and transient anorexia developed. Rabbits were treated with fluids, analgesics, antibiotics, and fitted with Elizabethan collars. They were housed in isolation to limit excessive environmental stimulation, which could alarm them and provoke \"thumping\" of the rear legs.

The problem of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty remains the major limiting factor of the procedure. Over the last 10 years, investigators have been studying the use of radiation therapy for preventing restenosis after angioplasty or stent placement. Since radiotherapy has been proven in other cases to be effective in disrupting the cell cycle regulatory proteins and thereby slowing or stopping growth, it was decided to apply the same principle to neointimal hyperplasia. To review the data that have emerged regarding vascular radiation with an emphasis on irradiated stents, 65 articles were reviewed and both preclinical and clinical experiments were included. Overall, studies with gamma and beta radiation show promising results. Endovascular gamma radiation has been shown effective in randomized trials, even at 3-year follow-up. Beta radiation is preferred because of greater safety and localization, and because it has also shown encouraging results in initial clinical trials, as well as in larger randomized studies. Consequently, the Federal Drug Administration has approved the use of both. In both types of endovascular brachytherapy, it seems the greater the dose, the better the initial response. Safety concerns include an increased incidence of late thrombosis and greater restenosis at margins. With irradiated stents, however, the situation is not as clear. At times, animal models have presented confusing results. These have ranged from significant suppression of hyperplasia to outright adverse effects of radiation on the vessel wall. While some clinical trials have been encouraging, others have not. Follow-up of up to 1 year has been disappointing so far. Many issues, such as the \"candy wrapper\" effect and rebound hyperplasia, must be dealt with before this becomes a viable form of therapy. It has become clear that radiation therapy in this setting, while having potentially great benefits, can cause deleterious effects as well. However, the mixed bag of positive and negative results seen so far, and the attractiveness of stents or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty being \"restenosis-proofed,\" eventually is cause for cautious optimism.", "answer": "Increased incidence of late thrombosis, greater restenosis at margins, \"candy wrapper\" effect, and rebound hyperplasia.", "covered": false}

Analyses techniques used in those studies required sample retrieval from solution, which may alter the sample surface. In this work FTIR/ ATR was used in analysis, enabling in situ study of the transformation within the aqueous environment. To test the biocompatibility of this brushite, cellular response to the transformation needs to be understood. Cellular response was initiated by bovine serum albumin adsorption on the brushite surface. The response was studied by monitoring the conformation of the adsorbed protein, which is critical to cellular reaction. This required monitoring the brushite transformation and surface adsorbed protein conformation simultaneously which can be realized using FTIR/ATR.

Ion chromatography (IC) is widely used for the compliance monitoring of common inorganic anions in drinking water. However, there has recently been considerable interest in the development of IC methods to meet regulatory requirements for analytes other than common inorganic anions, including disinfection byproduct anions, perchlorate, and haloacetic acids. Many of these new methods require the use of large injection volumes, high capacity columns and analyte specific detection schemes, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or postcolumn reaction with UV-Vis detection, in order to meet current regulatory objectives. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is a detection technique that is particularly suitable for the analysis of permanently ionized or polar, ionizable compounds. The combination of IC with MS detection is emerging as an important tool for the analysis of ionic compounds in drinking water, as it provides increased specificity and sensitivity compared to conductivity detection.

For Stomoxys landing on adult cattle, only 27% took a full meal (mean feeding time = 147 s). Most Stomoxys left the host before completing their meal, largely due to disturbance by the host's defensive behaviour (24%, mean time = 59 s) or other flies (44%, 71 s). The probability of a Stomoxys leaving the host progressively increased with time. Simultaneous observations of tsetse showed that, compared to Stomoxys, their feeding success was lower (15%), feeding was interrupted earlier (33 s) and the time taken to complete a meal was shorter (109 s). Further studies of tsetse across different seasons and hosts showed that feeding success varied according to host age (adult = 7%; calf = 3%) and was negatively correlated with the frequency of host defensive behaviour and the relative abundance of non-biting Diptera. Disturbances were more often caused by host behaviour (69%) than other flies (31%) and the probability of tsetse leaving decreased with time on the host. Overall, these results suggest that tsetse and Stomoxys have different feeding strategies. In particular, tsetse appear to be more responsive to host defensive behaviour, which reduces their feeding success relative to Stomoxys. These behavioural differences are consistent with the respective life-history characteristics of Stomoxys and tsetse.", "answer": "Host defensive behavior and interference from other flies.", "covered": false}

This objective was accomplished by monitoring the environmental concentrations of TCS, higher chlorinated derivatives of TCS (4,5-dichloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol [tetra II]; 5,6-dichloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol [tetra III]; and 4,5,6-trichloro-2-(2,4-dichloro-phenoxy)-phenol [penta]), and a potential biotransformation by-product of TCS (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dicholoro-phenoxy]-anisole [TCS-OMe]) during wastewater treatment. These analytes were isolated from wastewater by using a C18 solid-phase extraction column and from sludge with supercritical fluid CO2.

Recovery of TCS from laboratory-spiked wastewater samples ranged from 79 to 88% for influent, 36 to 87% for final effluent, and 70 to 109% for primary sludge. Field concentrations of TCS in influent wastewater ranged from 3.8 to 16.6 microg/L and concentrations for final effluent ranged from 0.2 to 2.7 microg/L. Removal of TCS by activated-sludge treatment was approximately 96%, whereas removal by trickling-filter treatment ranged from 58 to 86%.

A long retention interval tends to result in the poor retention known as forgetting. A high subjective similarity between stimuli frequently produces their poor retention. Thus, a long retention interval may increase the subjective similarity between stimuli (the RIISS hypothesis), and this increase may produce forgetting. To examine this hypothesis, college students made speeded same-different discriminations between two lines or tones of different lengths or frequencies that were 400 ms or 3,300 ms apart, and they rated the similarity of these stimuli. The long interval produced poorer overall performance as expected, but also produced poorer performance on different than same stimuli, implying that it increased the subjective similarity between the initial and subsequent stimuli, and it also increased rated similarity, in support of the RIISS hypothesis. The position that stored stimuli lose less common information than distinctive information explains RIISS evidence better than does perturbation theory.", "answer": "High subjective similarity leads to poor retention.", "covered": false}

Lanthanide emissions to the environment increase as a result of the growing industrial applications of these elements. However, robust data to evaluate the environmental fate of lanthanides are scarce. This article describes the accumulation and elimination of lanthanum (La) by common duckweed (Lemna minor L.). Speciation modeling was performed to assure that solubility products were not exceeded. It also showed that La was predominantly associated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Lanthanum concentrations in plants and medium and the amounts sorbed to glass vessels were quantified by using the radioisotope 140La. The amount of La adsorbed on the glass reached values of 25% of the total La present. A model was formulated to describe La uptake in exponentially growing duckweed in the presence of an adsorptive surface. Growth-induced dilution appeared more efficient in lowering plant La concentrations than actual elimination. An elimination study revealed two compartments, of which the smallest eliminated 50 times faster than the bigger compartment, which eliminated mainly by growth dilution. The average bioconcentration factor was 2,000 L/kg fresh weight and 30,000 L/kg dry weight, comparable with those of other higher plants. At the applied concentration of 10 nM, no effects were observed on duckweed growth.

The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy. Unfractionated heparin (UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers theoretical advantages over UH, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves. The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. There were eight series and six case reports. None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete. After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups).

A total of 24 students were identified from Years 4 and 5 of the undergraduate medical course at our medical school. Students invited to participate were identified following failure in summative and/or continuous assessment processes. Students underwent an individual educational diagnosis by means of free discussion and a semi-structured interview. Each negotiated a problem list, action plan and learning contract with course tutors. Of the 24 students, 16 received academic support and tutorials. Tutorial content was determined by individual students and took place over a 6-12-month period, initially individually and subsequently in pairs. Regular feedback and appraisal occurred. Information was delivered to the medical school academic progress review system. Student satisfaction was investigated and subsequent examination scores reviewed. The causes of academic failure were widespread and ranged from deficient study skills to financial, domestic and emotional problems.

Salmonella infections are a serious public health problem in developing countries and represent a constant concern for the food industry. The severity and the outcome of a systemic Salmonella infection depends on the \"virulence\" of the bacteria, on the infectious dose as well as on the genetic makeup and immunological status of the host. The control of bacterial growth in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the early phases of a Salmonella infection relies on the NADPH oxidase-dependent anti-microbial functions of resident phagocytes and is controlled by the innate resistance gene Nramp1. This early phase is followed by the suppression of Salmonella growth in the RES due to the onset of an adaptive host response. This response relies on the concerted action of a number of cytokines (TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12, IL18, and IL15), on the recruitment of inflammatory phagocytes in the tissues and on the activation of the recruited cells. Phagocytes control bacterial growth in this phase of the infection by producing reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) generated via the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Clearance of the bacteria from the RES at a later stage of the infection requires the CD28-dependent activation of CD4+ TCR-alphabeta T-cells and is controlled by MHC class II genes. Resistance to re-infection with virulent Salmonella micro-organisms requires the presence of Th1 type immunological memory and anti-Salmonella antibodies. Thus, the development of protective immunity to Salmonella infections relies on the cross-talk between the humoral and cellular branches of the immune system.", "answer": "Nramp1 controls bacterial growth in the reticuloendothelial system during the early phases of a Salmonella infection by regulating the NADPH oxidase-dependent anti-microbial functions of resident phagocytes.", "covered": false}

Although, any comparison between the isolation methods needs to consider that XAD-8 is specifically designed to isolate the humic fraction, whereas RO concentrates a broad range of organic matter and is not specific to humics. The comparison included for all samples: weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), polydispersity (rho), absorbance at 280 nm normalized to moles C (epsilon280) (RFW and isolates); and for isolates only: elemental analysis, % carbon distribution by 13C NMR, and aqueous FTIR spectra. As expected, RO isolation gave higher yield of NOM than XAD-8, but also higher ash content, especially Si and S. Mw decreased in the order: RO &gt; XAD-8 &gt; RFW &gt; XAD-4. The Mw differences of isolates compared with RFW may be due to selective isolation (fractionation), or possibly in the case of RO to condensation or coagulation during isolation. 13C NMR results were roughly similar for the two methods, but the XAD-8 isolate was slightly higher in 'aromatic' C and the RO isolate was slightly higher in heteroaliphatic and carbonyl C. Infrared spectra indicated a higher carboxyl content for the XAD-8 isolates and a higher ester:carboxyl ratio for the RO isolates. The spectroscopic data thus are consistent with selective isolation of more hydrophobic compounds by XAD-8, and also with potential ester hydrolysis during that process, although further study is needed to determine whether ester hydrolysis does indeed occur. Researchers choosing between XAD and RO isolation methods for NOM need to consider first the purpose of the isolation; i.e., whether humic fractionation is desirable. Beyond that, they should consider the C yield and ash content, as well as the potential for alteration of NOM by ester hydrolysis (XAD) or condensation/coagulation (RO). Furthermore, the RO and XAD methods produce different fractions or isolates so that researchers should be careful when comparing the compositions and reactivities of NOM samples isolated by these two different techniques.", "answer": "RO isolation results in a higher yield and higher ash content compared to XAD-8.", "covered": false}

The receptor cells send impulses back to the brain through the cochlear part of the vestibulocochlear nerve [VIII] where they are interpreted as sound. If the sounds are too loud, causing excessive movement of the tympanic membrane, contraction of the tensor tympani muscle (attached to the malleus) and/or the stapedius muscle (attached to the stapes) dampens the vibrations of the ossicles and decreases the force of the vibrations reaching the oval window.

The effects of different degrees of alveolar ventilation on the pulmonary response to methacholine and the role of humidity and temperature in this response were evaluated. Wistar rats were anaesthetized, tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated. Increasing doses of methacholine were infused intravenously and respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) were measured. The rats were ventilated with dry air at 13 degrees C, dry air at 37 degrees C, humid air at 13 degrees C and humid air at 37 degrees C.

This study explored the association between biomarkers of type I collagen metabolism and exposure to physical workload. In a prospective cohort study, serum concentrations of markers of type I collagen synthesis and degradation were assessed monthly for student nurses who worked as nurses for a period of 6 months and compared with those of a reference group. The number of patient-handling activities was estimated from observations at the workplace. Linear generalized estimating equations were used to analyze differences in the serum concentrations of the biomarkers between the exposed group and reference group, as well as to analyze whether the number of patient-handling activities was associated with serum concentrations of the biomarkers. Serum concentrations of the biomarkers were found to differ between the groups. The biomarkers reflected a higher anabolism of type I collagen in the exposed group when compared with that of the reference group. An analysis of the effect of the number of patient-handling activities revealed that a higher exposure was associated with higher effective type I collagen synthesis within the exposed group. These results indicate that serum concentrations of these biomarkers of type I collagen metabolism can reflect differences in exposure between contrasting groups, and also varying levels of exposure between persons within an occupation.", "answer": "The association between biomarkers of type I collagen metabolism and exposure to physical workload.", "covered": false}

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are attractive targets for gene therapy because of their capacity for self renewal and the wide systemic distribution of their progeny. Sustained expression of transgenes at clinically relevant levels in the progeny of HSCs would provide novel and potentially curative treatments for a wide range of inherited and acquired blood diseases. Recent improvements in retroviral transduction protocols have resulted in the first successful amelioration of a human hematologic disease--a form of severe combined immunodeficiency--by HSC gene transfer. However, continued advances in gene transfer technology are necessary if the inherent promise of HSC gene therapy is to be fully realized. Ongoing efforts are focused on modifying oncoretroviral vector designs and pseudotyping with alternative envelope proteins. In addition, because of their ability to transduce non-divided cells, safety-modified human immunodeficiency virus-1-based lentiviral vectors have emerged as promising tools for gene modification of HSCs, which reside primarily in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Irrespective of these advances, accumulated data indicate that stably integrated transgenes are frequently subject to position-effect variegation and extinction of expression. Therefore, the extent to which genetic control elements such as chromatin domain insulators and scaffold/matrix attachment regions in conjunction with posttranscriptional regulatory elements will result in enhanced probability and level of transgene expression is under active investigation. Collectively, these developments increase the likelihood that HSC gene transfer will ultimately become an effective therapeutic strategy.", "answer": "Hematopoietic stem cells are attractive targets for gene therapy because of their capacity for self-renewal and the systemic distribution of their progeny.", "covered": false}

Questionnaires were sent to al pre-registration house officers working in the three teaching hospitals in the Manchester area. Measures included demographic items, hours of actual work and the GHQ-12 as a measure of psychological distress, as well as validated Likert scales of job satisfaction, perceived work demands, support from superior,and experience and attitudes towards PBL. The response rate was 87% (66/76). Almost one-third of respondents (20/66) worked more than 72 hours a week. The occupational and psychological measures were significantly interrelated. The multiple regression analysis revealed that work demands and job satisfaction together accounted for over 45% of the variance in psychological distress. The other demographic, occupational and PBL-related factors did not make an independent contribution to distress. Scores were similar for respondents with high and low levels of exposure to PBL, and similar to scores obtained from a previous cohort of house officers graduating from a traditional course. These findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the small size of the current study and the setting.

The temporal changes and spatial variability of phosphorus and nitrogen losses and concentrations in Finland during the period 1981-1997 were studied in 15 small agricultural and forested catchments. In addition, four coastal river basins with high agricultural land use located in southern Finland were included in the study in order to assess the representativeness of agricultural loss estimates from small agricultural catchments. The mean annual loss specific for agricultural land was estimated to be on average 110 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total phosphorus and 1500 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total nitrogen. The results from small agricultural catchments were in agreement with the corresponding loss estimates from rivers, with an average of 137 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total phosphorus and 1800 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total nitrogen. The results from the studied agricultural catchments and rivers during the period 1981-1997 suggest that weather-driven fluctuation in discharge was usually the main reason for changes in nutrient losses, and little or no impact of changes in agricultural production or management practises can be observed. In forested areas the total phosphorus loss (average 9 kg km(-2) a(-1)) and total nitrogen loss (average 250 kg km(-2) a(-1)) were lower than in agricultural areas.

Ricin is about 30 times more effective in cell culture than viscumin. The dissociation of subunits and the transmembrane transport of catalytic subunit into the cytoplasm are needed to obtain the cytotoxic effect of RIP2. In this paper, hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against catalytic subunits of ricin and viscumin are described. Monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes, including one localized in intra-subunit area of catalytic subunits of ricin and viscumin, do not inhibit the enzymatic activity of these proteins in cell-free system.

This concept has recently been applied to colorectal cancers, but the method used is unique because oncologic principles of resection are still adhered to for the primary tumor along with en bloc resection of the locoregional mesenteric nodes, some of which are sentinel nodes. Sentinel nodes are ideal for sensitive pathologic techniques of detecting micrometastatic disease, as they often reflect the status of the entire locoregional nodal basin.

Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) complicating the acute phase of myocardial infarction (AMI) is a quite rare event but with short-term unfavorable prognosis. The clinical characteristics as well as the therapeutic implications have not yet been well defined. This paper attempts to prove that VT may be considered a marker of inadequate myocardial perfusion after thrombolysis. To assess the clinic-electroangiographic characteristics and prognosis of patients with VT occurring within the first 4 days of an AMI, a case-control study was carried out in 23 patients from a total of 1,100 patients (1.9%) hospitalized with AMI between March 1993 and July 1997. These patients were compared with a control group of 131 patients hospitalized consecutively. A statistical analysis was made using the chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression. There were no differences among groups with regard to age, gender, and area of necrosis. Average time for the onset of VT was 26 h (range 0-92 h). Sixteen patients underwent coronary angiography: 4 patients had left main coronary artery disease, 2 had single-vessel disease, 8 had lesions in two vessels, and 2 had triple-vessel disease.

The term appraisal lacks useful definition. It is used to describe both the summative assessment which forms part of performance management, as well as an educational process sometimes referred to as formative assessment. In this analysis we trace the purpose of each of these components as applied to career grade doctors. In the first, authority for the process, and the motive for applying it, lies with management. Within a publicly funded health service the purpose of this is directed towards equality of health care, and to obtain the greatest performance available with the resources available. By contrast, appraisal which supports a doctor's self-directed learning is likely to address issues of quality. The two processes exist in tension with each other, and are mutually informative.

Tobacco use is the single most important preventable health risk in the developed world, and an important cause of premature death worldwide. Smoking causes a wide range of diseases, including many types of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and peptic ulcer disease. In addition, smoking during pregnancy adversely affects fetal and neonatal growth and development. Recent decades have seen a massive expansion in tobacco use in the developing world and accelerating growth in smoking among women in the developed world. Globally, smoking-related mortality is set to rise from 3 million annually (1995 estimate) to 10 million annually by 2030, with 70% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking are reversible, and smoking cessation treatments represent some of the most cost effective of all healthcare interventions. Although the greatest benefit accrues from ceasing smoking when young, even quitting in middle age avoids much of the excess healthcare risk associated with smoking. In order to improve smoking cessation rates, effective behavioural and pharmacological treatments, coupled with professional counselling and advice, are required. Since smoking duration is the principal risk factor for smoking-related morbidity, the treatment goal should be early cessation and prevention of relapse.", "answer": "It is important to focus on early cessation and prevention of relapse in smoking cessation treatments to reduce the duration of exposure to smoking's harmful effects and to sustain the health benefits of quitting.", "covered": false}

Somatic gene therapy is supposed to cure life-threatening hematopoietic disorders but is limited by unstable transgene expression. Efficient gene transfer to hematopoietic progenitor cells does not ensure long-term gene expression. It would therefore be advantageous if the expression of transgenes could be restored in bone marrow. Transfer of drug resistance genes such as the multidrug resistance (MDR1) or mutated dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes to hematopoietic cells protects them from the toxicity of anticancer drugs. In addition, transduced cells obtain a selective growth advantage in the presence of anticancer drugs. This can be used to introduce and enrich otherwise non-selectable genes by cotransfer to target cells. Bicistronic vectors have been constructed for coexpression of drug resistance genes and non-selectable, therapeutic genes with the use of an internal ribosomal entry-site (IRES).

The 67 mosquitoes comprised a mixture of An. arabiensis Patton (31%) and An. quadriannulatus Theobald (69%). DNA from one or both of the cattle present in the hut was detected in 91% of samples. When the hut contained an adult and a calf, the percentage of bloodmeals from the adult, the calf and adult + calf were 58%, 27% and 15%, respectively; the trend towards meals from the adult host was consistent but not always significant.

There was no significant difference in the pattern of host selection made by An. arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus but the former had a significantly higher percentage (20%) of mixed meals than An. quadriannulatus (9%). These two members of the An. gambiae complex appear to be less selective in their choice of cattle hosts compared to day-active Diptera such as tsetse and Stomoxys, possibly because the hosts are generally asleep when Anopheles are active and there is therefore less selective pressure to adapt to host defensive behaviour.

The main targets of G proteins through which GPCRs work are the adenyl cyclase which is the enzyme responsible for the formation of the second messenger (intracellular signal transduction) cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); the phospholipase C is the enzyme responsible for the formation of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol; and several ion channels such as the calcium and potassium channels. According to this last mechanism, GPCRs can directly control the activity of ion channels through mechanisms that do not involve the second messengers (eg, cAMP).

The pathway for intracortical fluid flow response to a step-load was identified in vivo using intramedullary pressure (ImP) and streaming potential (SP) measurements, and allowed the development of a load-induced flow mechanism which considers mechanotransduction and mechanoelectrotransduction phenomena. An avian model was used for monitoring, simultaneously, ImP and SP under axial loading which generated peak strains of approximately 600 microstrain (microepsilon). ImP response to step-load decayed more quickly than SP relaxation, in which multiple time constants were observed during the relaxations. While the initial relaxation of SP showed a decay on the order of 200 ms, ImP decayed on the order of approximately 100 ms. After the initial decay (approximately 200 ms after loading), ImP quickly relaxed to base line, while SP continued to dominate relaxation. It appears that the decay of ImP is indicative of resistive fluid flow occurring primarily in the vasculature and other intraosseous channels such as lacunar-canalicular pores, and that SP represents the fluid flow in the smaller porosities, i.e., lacunar-canalicular system or even microspores.

Phenotypes that are either resistant or susceptible to infection by the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni exist in the tropical freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata. We tested the hypothesis that a cost of parasite resistance in B. glabrata is greater sensitivity to cadmium toxicity, using parasite-resistant and parasite-susceptible strains exposed to cadmium in the laboratory. Survival analysis showed that time to death for cadmium was significantly shorter in eggs, juveniles, and adults of the parasite-resistant BS90 strain in comparison with the parasite-susceptible NMRI strain. Cadmium exposure increased time to hatch in both strains, but the effect was greater in BS90. Percentage hatch decreased with increased cadmium; BS90 was again more sensitive than NMRI. Comparison of the median effective concentration (EC50) for hatching and median lethal concentrations (LC50s) for survival of juveniles and adults showed that the order for cadmium resistance was adults &gt; juveniles &gt; eggs in NMRI and adults &gt; eggs &gt; juveniles in BS90. Cadmium resistance of F1 and F2 progeny of BS90/NMRI crosses was intermediate to that of parental strains.

Square fields with widths ranging from 1 cm to 15 cm were observed; the OF for the different field sizes was normalized to that measured at a 5 cm x 5 cm field size at a depth of 10 cm. The BEAM/EGS4 program was used to simulate the exact geometry of a 6 MV photon beam generated by the linear accelerator, and the DOSXYZ-code was implemented to calculate the OFs for all field sizes.

In this paper, the characteristics of the DFPP treatments for critical care are summarized. During the DFPP treatments, the patient's blood volume (BV) often decreases with time due to albumin loss induced by inadequate albumin infusion in a supplementation fluid. We examined the change of BV by a continuous hematocrit monitor, Crit-Line, during an in vivo study for 9 patients. As a result, albumin loss fairly occurred in DFPP treatments. The decrease of patient BV was induced by an oncotic pressure drop due to albumin loss and often resulted in a blood pressure drop. This is a serious problem for DFPP in critical care.

Gp130 mRNA of 9.0 and 7.5 kb were detected in a variety of rat tissues including the testis. Gp130 mRNAs were detected in isolated, immature Sertoli cells. The levels of gp130 were significantly stimulated by the addition of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not by the addition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

We conducted a static IMRT technique adding 2 or smaller complementary boost-fields to the underdosed volume in the PTV, which resulted from complete blocking of the orbits in all coplanar or non-coplanar main ports of the standard 3-D CRT. The standard 3-D CRT plans (Plan A) and IMRT plans adding complementary boost fields (Plan B) were established for 10 patients with ethmoid sinus cancer.

Attempts to improve the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies have led to the development of innovative strategies that combine the high specificity of antibody molecules with the efficient trafficking properties and effector functions of immune cells. These antigen-selective cell therapies are designed to convert therapeutically important native antigens expressed on the cell surface (tumor associated antigens, viral envelope proteins) into recruitment points of effector functions, and address the goal of major histocompatibility complex- and exogenous cytokine-independent activation of mature effector T-cells. The most promising and best characterized antigen-selective strategy is based on the genetic manipulation of the recognition specificity of T-cells by grafting the recognition specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a lymphocyte triggering molecule (TCR-associated polypeptides, Fc epsilon RI-gamma chain). Upon encountering specific antigen, cells harboring chimeric immune receptors (CIRs) are able to undergo specific stimulation and kill antigen bearing cells in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Initial studies have focused on terminally differentiated effector cell-based protocols. However, recent data indicate that progenitor cell-based therapies allow the permanent generation of stable populations of CIR-expressing cells of multiple lineages, leading to long-term persistent systemic immunity. Emerging gene therapy strategies are based on the use of biespecic antibody fragments. The advantages of these biespecic antibody-mediated immune recruitment (BIR) approaches (trans-recruitment and multieffector activation) could complement conventional CIR-based immunotherapies.

Current algal test protocols do not distinguish between chemical toxicity and growth inhibition due to physical shading when coloured substances like dyes are evaluated. To eliminate the interfering physical effect, we investigated the importance of light intensity and culture volume in the algal growth inhibition tests with Desmodesmus subspicatus and three selected dyestuffs. A photon flux density above light saturation is needed to prevent inhibition of algal growth solely due to the light absorption by dyes. Furthermore, a smaller culture volume and moderate shaking of the test flasks is advantageous in that these conditions decrease the influence of the light absorption. At 120 microE s(-1) m(-2), the shading effect of three tested dyes could be eliminated, up to a concentration of 100 mg l(-1). In a mixture with a blue dyestuff, the model toxicant potassium dichromate showed nearly the same EC50 as if applied alone, indicating that the impact of the dye was negligible. Also a small culture volume decreases the inhibition of the average growth rate of Desmodesmus. Thus, by increasing the light intensity and optionally also reducing the culture volume, this method allows a more direct measure of a potential inherent chemical toxicity of coloured substances to algae. Additionally, high light intensities and lower culture volumes result in lower coefficients of variation, which improves the sensitivity of the test for the statistical calculation of toxicity data.", "answer": "120 microE s(-1) m(-2)", "covered": false}

Mitochondria have been suggested as key players in apoptotic cell death of neurons and many other tissues, since the release of proapoptotic molecules from mitochondria is implicated in caspase activation. As a potential release mechanism, the occurrence of a large pore opening in the inner membrane (mitochondrial permeability transition pore, PTP) has been proposed, but has not yet been observed directly in neurons. We investigated whether the calcein/Co2+-quenching technique introduced by Petronilli et al. [Biofactors 8 (1998) 263], which allows direct observation of PTP opening, can be applied to neurons. Exposure of calcein-loaded neurons to Co2+ ions resulted in the fading of diffuse cytoplasmic calcein fluorescence, with organelle-restricted fluorescent spots remaining. These spots were colocalized with mitochondrially-entrapped tetramethylrhodamineethylester (TMRE) fluorescence and corresponded to colocalization of calcein and TMRE fluorescence in digitonin-permeabilized neurons. Importantly, extensive neuronal calcium loading, which is assumed to induce PTP opening, resulted in significant fading of mitochondrial fluorescence, suggesting the occurrence of permeability transition.

Sediment samples were collected at 30 stations with a 0.1 m2 grab from which subsamples were taken for sediment toxicity testing and geochemical and macrofaunal analyses. Standard 10-d sediment-amphipod toxicity tests were conducted with Rhepoxynius abronius and Leptocheiros plumulosus. Sediments were analyzed for 33 PAHs, pentachlorophenol, polychlorinated biphenyls, acid-volatile sulfide, simultaneously extracted metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni), total organic carbon, and grain size. Sediment temperature, oxygen-reduction potential, water depth, and interstitial water salinity were also measured. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, quantified as total PAH toxic units (TU(PAH)), were confirmed to be an important common causal agent of the changes in the two toxicity test (% survival R. abronius, % survival L. plumulosus) and five macrofaunal community (number of species, S; numerical abundance, A: total biomass, B: Swartz's dominance index, SDI; Brillouin's index, H) endpoints. Two other macrofaunal community metrics (the complement of Simpson's index, 1 - SI, and McIntosh's index, MI) were less sensitive to TU(PAH) than the two toxicity test endpoints. The sensitivities of R. abronius and L. plumulosus to TU(PAH) were statistically indistinguishable. Field validations were conducted by testing the association between or among each toxicity test endpoint, each of seven macrofaunal community metrics (S, A, B, SDI, H, 1 - SI, MI), and TU(PAH) by (1) Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation, (2) Kendall's coefficient of concordance, (3) G tests of independence, and (4) regression analysis. Some field validations based on multivariable tests of association (e.g., points 2 and 3) among toxicity test, field, and stressor endpoints produced false positive results.

Using an in vivo murine model of inflammation, we assessed tissue responses to globular and to elongated ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) particles with a similar surface area, and investigated whether inflammation and cellular apoptosis varied with particle shape in the debris-tissue interaction. Histological changes of UHMWPE-stimulated pouch membrane were assessed using a computerized image analysis system. Quantitative real time PCR and ELISA were performed to assess mRNA expression and protein level of the cytokines, and TUNEL assays were conducted to quantify apoptotic cells. The data revealed that elongated particles generated more active inflammatory air pouches, stimulated more severe membrane proliferation and the inflammatory cellular infiltration compared to globular particles. Increased levels of IL-1beta and TNFalpha were detected in the lavage and homogenate of pouches stimulated with elongated particles in comparison to pouches with globular particles, and the apoptotic assay indicated more severe apoptotic changes within the inflammatory membrane provoked with elongated particles.

In allergic patients with rhinoconjunctivitis (RNC), sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is effective in reducing both clinical symptoms and immuno-mediated local inflammatory responses. The study evaluates whether SLIT could reduce upper airway inflammation and improve clinical parameters also in children with rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma from house dust mite sensitization. Ten children with mild to intermittent asthma, monosensitized to house dust mites, received SLIT (Der p 1 monthly dose = 48 microg) for 2 years, in addition to \"as needed\" pharmacologic treatment. Before (T0) and after treatment (T2), changes were evaluated in (1) nasal eosinophilia, (2) intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression by nasal epithelial cells, (3) RNC, asthma, and drug-intake scores, assessed by diary card, (4) pulmonary function parameters, and (5) bronchial reactivity to methacholine (MCh). All children completed the study without side or adverse effects. After the treatment period, we found no modification in nasal eosinophil values in mean fluorescence channel percentages, but a significant downregulation in ICAM-1 expression by nasal epithelial cells [mean (mfc): T0: 13.5 +/- 3.8 mfc; T2:4.6 +/- 0.5 mfc; p = 0.04].

Triclosan (TCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol) is a widely used antimicrobial agent. To understand its fate during sewage treatment, the biodegradation and removal of TCS were determined in activated sludge. In addition, the effects of TCS on treatment processes were assessed. Fate was determined by examining the biodegradation and removal of TCS radiolabeled with 14C in the 2,4-dichlorphenoxy ring in laboratory batch mineralization experiments and bench-top continuous activated-sludge (CAS) systems. In batch experiments with unacclimated sludge, TCS was mineralized to 14CO2, but the total yield varied as a function of test concentration. Systems that were redosed with TCS exhibited more extensive and faster mineralization, indicating that adaptation was a critical factor determining the rate and extent of biodegradation. In a CAS study in which the influent level of TCS was incrementally increased from 40 microg/L to 2,000 microg/L, removal of the parent compound exceeded 98.5% and removal of total radioactivity (parent and metabolites) exceeded 85%. Between 1.5 and 4.5% of TCS in the influent was sorbed to the wasted solids, whereas &gt;94% underwent primary biodegradation and 81 to 92% was mineralized to CO2 or incorporated in biomass. Increasing levels of TCS in the influent had no major adverse effects on any wastewater treatment process, including chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, and ammonia removal. In a subsequent experiment, a CAS system, acclimated to TCS at 35 microg/L, received two separate 4-h shock loads of 750 microg/L TCS. Neither removal of TCS nor treatment processes exhibited major adverse effects. An additional CAS study was conducted to examine the removal of a low level (10 microg/L) of TCS. Removal of parent equaled 94.7%, and biodegradation remained the dominant removal mechanism. A subsequent series of CAS experiments examined removal at four influent concentrations (7.5, 11, 20, and 50 microg/L) of TCS and demonstrated that removal of parent ranged from 98.2 to 99.3% and was independent of concentration. Although TCS removal across all experiments appeared unrelated to influent concentration, removal was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.87) with chemical oxygen demand removal, indicating that TCS removal was related to overall treatment efficiency of specific CAS units. In conclusion, the experiments show that TCS is extensively biodegraded and removed in activated-sludge systems and is unlikely to upset sewage treatment processes at levels expected in household and manufacturing wastewaters.", "answer": "The relationship between TCS removal and chemical oxygen demand removal in the conducted experiments was significantly correlated, with a correlation coefficient (r^2) of 0.87, indicating that TCS removal was related to the overall treatment efficiency of the specific CAS units.", "covered": false}

Human gene therapy promises to change the practice of medicine by treating the causes of disease rather than the symptoms. Since the first clinical trial made its debut ten years ago, there are over 400 approved protocols in the United States alone, most of which have failed to show convincing data of clinical efficacy. This setback is largely due to the lack of efficient and adequate gene transfer vehicles. With the recent progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of human diseases and the imminent arrival of the post genomic era, there are increasing numbers of therapeutic genes or targets that are available for gene therapy. Therefore, the urgency and need for efficacious gene therapies are greater than ever. Clearly, the current fundamental obstacle is to develop delivery vectors that exhibit high efficacy and specificity of gene transfer. Recombinant adenoviruses have provided a versatile system for gene expression studies and therapeutic applications. Of late, there has been a remarkable increase in adenoviral vector-based clinical trials. Recent endeavors in the development of recombinant adenoviral vectors have focused on modification of virus tropism, accommodation of larger genes, increase in stability and control of transgene expression, and down-modulation of host immune responses.

Are there any useful markers for predicting outcome after Helicobacter pylori eradication? Although Helicobacter pylori eradication is effective in treating low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the condition in some patients deteriorates even after the eradication. Therefore, it is important to predict the disease outcome before starting H. pylori eradication. We investigated the usefulness of flow cytometry, quantifying CD19- and CD20-positive B lymphocytes in MALT lymphoma tissue, for predicting the disease outcome after H. pylori eradication. Tissue specimens from 14 patients with H. pylori-positive low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma were examined by histology, Southern blotting, and flow cytometry before therapy. Serum levels of soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor were also measured. The relationship between the data and the prognosis after H. pylori eradication was analyzed. Remission occurred in 10 of the 14 patients. The condition in the 4 remaining patients deteriorated even after H. pylori eradication. The percentages of CD19- and CD20-positive cells in MALT lymphoma tissue from the patients in remission were both significantly lower than those in the tissue from patients not in remission. Indeed, 4 of the 5 patients in whom both CD19- and CD20-positive cells accounted for more than 50% of the total number of lymphocytes had gastrectomy, whereas all patients in whom both CD19- and CD20-positive cells accounted for less than 50% of the total number of lymphocytes achieved remission. Although immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was present in all patients operated on, there were also 6 patients whose MALT lymphoma was ameliorated in spite of the presence of gene rearrangement. The serum level of soluble IL-2 receptor was in the normal range in all patients tested.

Treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES SCLC) or extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (EPSC) is typically palliative. We set out to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall long-term survival of ES SCLC and EPSC patients, physiologically aged &lt; or = 60 years, responding to first-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose combination alkylating agents with hematologic stem cell support. Patients in first-line chemotherapy response underwent stem cell collection (marrow, peripheral blood progenitor cells, or both) followed by high-dose therapy with 1 of 2 regimens: CBP (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine) or ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) with or without etanidazole. Involved-field radiotherapy was given to selected patients with oligometastatic disease distributed in sites allowing for reasonable radiation ports, and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy was given upon recovery to patients in complete response (CR) or near-CR. A total of 36 patients were treated. Of 29 patients with ES SCLC, 6 (21%) had achieved CR, 18 near-CR, and 5 partial response prior to high-dose therapy. Of 7 patients with EPSC, 3 (43%) had achieved CR, 3 had achieved near-CR, and 1 had progression of disease prior to high-dose therapy. Thirteen ES SCLC patients received high-dose CBP. Of the remaining 23 patients with SCLC or EPSC, 17 were treated with ICE and 6 with ICE plus etanidazole, a hypoxic cell sensitizer. Treatment-related mortality was 11% (4 of 36 patients). For all patients, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 5 months. The 2- and 5-year survivals after intensification were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%-31%) and 9% (95% CI, 3%-27%), respectively. Of the 30 patients in or near CR prior to high-dose therapy, 5 remain continuously progression-free (2 ES SCLC, 3 EPSC) for a median of 55 months (range, 1-96 months) after high-dose therapy. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with more favorable EFS were the use of a more aggressive induction regimen (ICE), and the EPSC histology. These factors were also associated with more favorable overall survival. Other factors associated with more favorable overall survival were the use of short induction therapy (&lt; or = 4 cycles) and younger age (&lt;50 years). Except for high-dose ICE with etanidazole, the use of high-dose systemic therapy in ES SCLC and EPSC was associated with low treatment-related morbidity and mortality over the past 5 years. Late complications were infrequent, and most patients returned to full-time work and activity, barring disease recurrence. Nonetheless, few patients with ES SCLC have progression-free long-term survival. We conclude that high-dose therapy is not indicated as an approach for ES SCLC, except as part of an investigative trial. Conversely, 3 of the 7 patients with EPSC remain relapse-free (range, 1-96 months), warranting further phase II evaluation of this approach in this population.", "answer": "6", "covered": false}

Over the last decade, increasing attention has been paid to the development of systems to deliver drugs for long periods at controlled rates. Some of these systems can deliver drugs continuously for over one year. However, little effort has been given to developing systems for the controlled release of nucleic acids. Recently, a novel gene transfer method which allows prolonged release and expression of plasmid DNA in vivo in normal adult animals was established. In this system, a biocompatible natural polymer such as collagen or its derivatives acts as the carrier for the delivery of DNA vectors. The biomaterial carrying the plasmid DNA was administered into animals and, once introduced, gradually released plasmid DNA in vivo. A single injection of plasmid DNA/biomaterial produced physiologically significant levels of gene-encoding proteins in the local/systemic circulation of animals and resulted in prolonged biological effects. These results suggest that the biomaterials carrying plasmid DNA may enhance the clinical potency of plasmid-based gene transfer, facilitating a more effective and long-term use of naked plasmid vectors for gene therapy. Furthermore, the biomaterials can be removed surgically, minimizing the effect of gene products if some unexpected side effects should be observed after application. The application of these systems to expand the bioavailability of molecular medicine, including antisense oligonucleotides and adenovirus vectors, and to aid in stem cell transplantation in the context of DNA-based tissue engineering will be discussed.", "answer": "Biomaterials can be utilized for the controlled release of molecular medicines by serving as carriers for DNA vectors, enabling prolonged release and expression of plasmid DNA in vivo, which leads to sustained biological effects.", "covered": false}

The development of hypertension is accompanied by changes in the rheological properties of blood, particularly by increased red blood cell (RBC) aggregation leading to further pathological complications. However, it is not clear whether these changes in aggregation are caused only by increased concentrations of plasma adhesion proteins or if alterations in RBC membranes are also involved. The aim of the present study was to determine if RBC aggregability is altered during hypertension and if these changes correlate with alterations in RBC membrane protein concentrations. Aggregability changes were evaluated by comparing fibrinogen (Fb)-induced aggregation of RBCs from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with RBCs from age matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. ANOVA showed a significant increase in dose-dependent Fb-induced aggregation of RBCs in the SHR group. Analysis of Coomassie-stained gels of RBC membrane proteins using SDS-PAGE showed a significant increase in the amount of a protein at 110 kD in the SHR group. These results show that increased RBC aggregability is accompanied by alterations in RBC membrane protein composition during hypertension development.", "answer": "A significant increase in the amount of a 110 kD protein in the RBC membrane.", "covered": false}

The long-term goal of this research is to develop and validate an in vivo reptile model for endocrine-mediated toxicity using fence lizards (Sceloporus spp.). One of the best defined estrogenic responses in oviparous vertebrates is induction of the yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin (Vtg). In this study, dose-response and time course relationships for Vtg induction were determined in male western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) given intraperitoneal injections of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Plasma Vtg was quantified directly with an antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirectly using plasma alkaline-labile phosphate (ALP) in order to compare these two methods. Both ELISA and ALP predicted similar median effective dose (ED50 [dose causing a 50% maximal response]) values for plasma Vtg induction (0.167 mg/kg for ELISA and 0.095 mg/kg for ALP). In addition, both ELISA and ALP detected significant Vtg induction at a dose of 0.0003 mg/kg of EE2, which was the lowest dose used in our study. A decrease in body weight at the highest dose (10 mg/kg) and an increase in hepatosomatic index at the four highest doses were observed. Serial dilutions of plasma from an EE2-exposed male revealed a high correlation between plasma Vtg and ALP determinations in this species. In conclusion, our data show that plasma ALP may be a suitable alternative for measuring plasma Vtg compared with developing a Vtg ELISA in fence lizards exposed to estrogenic compounds.", "answer": "0.167 mg/kg for ELISA and 0.095 mg/kg for ALP.", "covered": false}

The goal of this design was to minimize variance due to terrain influences on stream communities, while representing the range of hemlock dominated stream environments present in the park. We used geographic information systems (GIS) and cluster analysis to define and partition hemlock dominated streams into terrain types based on topographic variables and stream order. We computed similarity of forest stands within terrain types and used this information to pair hemlock-dominated streams with hardwood counterparts prior to sampling. We evaluated the effectiveness of the design through power analysis and found that power to detect differences in aquatic invertebrate taxa richness was highest when sites were paired and terrain type was included as a factor in the analysis.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_646_0", "question": "How does the frequency of bacteriuria compare in men after radical prostatectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution?", "doc_chunk": "Prospective study of urinary tract infections and urinary antibodies after radical prostatectomy and cystoprostatectomy. The authors have prospectively documented that men who undergo orthotopic bladder substitution more frequently experience bacteriuria than do normal men [19] or men with carcinoma of the prostate scheduled to have radical prostatectomy (see Table 1). Because the frequency of bacteriuria in men after prostatectomy was also lower than that after orthotopic bladder substitution (see Table 1), removal of the prostate and any of its presumed antibacterial properties probably does not account for this difference. Furthermore, the authors' data (see Table 5 ) and that of Woodside and associates [23] demonstrate that intestine incorporated into the genitourinary tract generates a local antibody response against urinary bacteria. Although others have suggested that the incorporation of bowel in the urinary tract may be associated with increased bacteriuria, this effect has never been documented prospectively. The mechanism of this increased frequency of bacteriuria is unknown. Because the anatomy of the male secretory genitourinary system may be altered after radical prostatectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution, the authors evaluated local antibody production before and after these operations. More than 20 years ago, Burdon [5] found that the initial portion of the VB1 sample in men had significantly higher levels of IgA compared with the VB2 specimen, whereas the levels of IgG were similar in the two portions. This latter finding was confirmed by Shorliffe and co-workers [22] when they examined prostatic secretion. Other investigators have found high levels of IgA in human prostatic tissue and fluid. [24,25]. On the basis of these findings, it was believed that, in men, the prostate produces most of the urinary IgA, whereas the bladder or upper urinary tracts make most of the urinary IgG. Although the authors' study confirms that most local urinary tract IgG is produced by the bladder or upper urinary tracts, this study documents that the prostate is not the only source of urethral IgA in men. Despite almost complete removal or prostate secretory epithelium by radical prostatectomy, as evidenced by a dramatic fall in postoperative VB1 and VB2 PSA compared with preoperative levels (Table 3). men who had this operation had only slightly decreased IgA levels after the operation (Table 4, Fig I). The source of this IgA must be urethral because the VB1 urinary stream contains more IgA than the VB2 urine even after radical prostatectomy. The authors have not determined whether the urinary IgA concentrations observed after radical prostatectomy are the true baseline values for a man without a prostate, or whether they actually reflect abnormal production of local IgA stimulated by radical prostatectomy. Because post-prostatectomy bacteriuris occurred frequently during urethral catheter drainage, the authors screened for postoperative IgA titers to mix 1 and mix 2 to determine whether specific production of antibody against gram-negative organisms might account for some of the postoperative IgA measured. Postradical prostatectomy mix 1 and mix 2 titers were not elevated, compared with preoperative measurements. Because urethral glandular tissue other than prostatic tissue is present in the male urethra, these glands also might be responsible for significant local antibody production. The high levels of urinary IgA and IgG after cystoprostatectomy with ileal orthotopic bladder substitution document that intestine incorporated into the urinary tract is still capable of producing local antibody. This observation corresponds with the findings of Mansson and associated [26] of elevated IgA and IgG in ileal reservoir urine compared with normal urinary tracts. It has been estimated that 1 m of intestine may secrete up to 780 mg/d of IgA [27], indicating that normal intestine production of antibody alone can account for the high IgA and IgG levels found in the patients who underwent bladder substitution. Interestingly, the ratio of IgA to IgG concentration in smal intestine fluid is 2:129, similar to the ratio of IgA to IgG in bladder substitution urine (2.92.1:52, Table 4). Because mix 1 and mix 2 IgA concentrations were elevated in VB1 and VB2 urine after ileal bladder substitution (see Table 5), some of this antibody was produced by the ileal bladder substitution in response to the inevitable bacteriuria that occurs during the prolonged postoperative catheter drainage. The findings is absent after radical prostatectomy alone. In addition, some of this increased antibody might be a result of the increased bacteriuria noted in the patients who underwent ileal bladder substitution after the initial postoperative period. The significance of the increased bacteriuria and elevated antibody levels after ileal bladder substitution is unclear. Because most of these episodes of bacteriuria were asymptomatic, whether they represent clinical infections that should be treated is not known. Bishop and associates [28] found that the bacterial flora of ileal conduits with asymptomatic bacteriuria had bacterial counts of 1000 or fewer colonies, and they noted that the healthy ileum in situ may contain more than 10,000 organisms per milliliter [29]. Because the normal urinary tract is usually sterile, it is possible that the bacteriuria found by the authors after ileal bladder substitution represents some form of bowel colonization more commonly associated with the bowel rather than clinical urinary tract infection and has limited clinial importance. Trinchieri and associated [30] found that urinary from patients with ileocystoplasty prevented attachment of E. coli to human uroepithelial cells more effectively that urine from patients with recurrent urinary infections. This observation suggests that the relatively large quantities of Iga produced by the ileal bladder substitution may, in fact, prevent clinical infection by preventing tissue invasion by the bacteria. Only long-term follow-up of patients with ileocystoplasty or ileal bladder substitution will determine the clinical significance of the bacteriuria. The authors' study had documented an increased incidence of bacteriuria in men after ileal bladder substitution and no such increase after radical prostatectomy. Analysis of the data shows that male sources other than the prostate--probably urethral glands-- must produce significant quantities of local urinary tract IgA. After ileal bladder substitution, the incorporated ileum may produce volumes of local antibody that may exceed the amounts ordinarily produce by the normal urinary tract. The clinical significance of the increased incidence of bacteriuria and elevated antibody levels in patients after illeal bladder substitution is unclear.", "answer": "Lower.", "covered": false}

Understanding the biomechanical effect of various factors on knee behavior after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or reconstruction is instrumental for the development of an optimal surgical treatment of ACL injury that can better restore normal knee function. This paper presents the application of a three-dimensional (3D) computational knee model for parametric studies of knee kinematics in response to simulated muscle loads. The knee model was constructed using the magnetic resonance images and biomechanical experimental data of the same cadaveric human knee specimen. The kinematics of the knee predicted by the computational model was compared with that measured from different specimens in a wide range of loading conditions and flexion angles. In general, the model predictions were within the range of experimental data. The model was then used to predict knee motion, ligament forces, and contact pressure in response to a simulated quadriceps force when the knee was ACL deficient. Partial ACL injury was simulated by reducing the stiffness of the ACL in the model. The results demonstrated that even with a reduction of 75% of the ACL stiffness, the ACL still carried a significant amount of the load (more than 58%) carried by an intact ACL. The kinematics (both tibial translation and rotation) varied less than 20% compared to that of the knee with intact ACL. The 3D computational model can be a powerful tool to simulate different variables that would influence knee function after ACL reconstruction, such as the initial tension of the ACL graft, the insertion sites of the graft, multibundle grafts, graft materials, and various physiological loading conditions.", "answer": "The factors that can be simulated using the 3D computational model to study knee function after ACL reconstruction include the initial tension of the ACL graft, the insertion sites of the graft, multibundle grafts, graft materials, and various physiological loading conditions.", "covered": false}

None of the established treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignant glioma has improved its very poor prognosis. Adjuvant locoregional radio-immunotherapy (RIT) represents a new therapeutic approach. We present our initial experience with this therapeutic tool with respect to adverse effects, biokinetics and clinical follow-up. Following surgery and radiotherapy, 12 patients with glioma (4, WHO stage III; 8, WHO stage IV) underwent 1-5 RIT-cycles (average dose 1100 MBq 131labelled monoclonal BC-4 antibodies) at six week intervals. Follow-up included serial FDG-PET and MRI investigations. Evaluation of biokinetics included whole body scans, together with analysis of blood, urine and fluid from the tumor cavity. Following RIT, four patients experienced temporary seizures, which, in one case, were associated with temporary aphasia. Eight patients developed HAMA (human anti-mouse antibodies) during follow-up. Mean biologic half-life of the radiopharmaceutical in the resection cavity was 3.9 d (range: 1.0-10.2 d) and remained stable intraindividually during further RIT-cycles. The antibody/radionuclide conjugate remained stable in the tumor cavity for at least 5 d. Median survival presently stands at 18.5 months compared to 9.7 months in a historical patient group (n = 89) undergoing conventional therapeutic strategies. Five patients show no signs of recurrence. In three patients with post-surgical evidence of residual tumor, one patient showed partial remission, one stable disease, and one progressive disease during RIT. Four patients without evidence of residual tumor mass at the beginning of RIT developed recurrence during therapy. Initial experience demonstrates that locoregional RIT is a well tolerated treatment modality that may represent a promising new approach in the management of patients with malignant glioma.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic, life-threatening hypermetabolic syndrome in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to certain anesthetic agents. Discovered by Denborough and Lovell [1] in 1960, MH was associated with high mortality and morbidity as the cause was unknown and an effective treatment was unavailable. There is no classic clinical presentation of the syndrome, and the onset and signs of MH are dependent upon known and unknown environmental and genetic factors. Initial theories involved central temperature regulation defects or uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [2], but later investigations targeted skeletal muscle as the affected organ. Subsequently freshly biopsied skeletal muscle was used for in vitro pharmacologic contracture testing to discriminate between normal and MH-affected muscle and remains the \"gold standard\" for MH diagnosis. Spontaneous, genetic models for MH were discovered in pigs and dogs and substantial knowledge about MH was gained from these valuable resources. The abnormal contracture response of MH skeletal muscle evoked a focus on calcium regulation, and abnormalities in calcium release (as opposed to calcium sequestration) mechanisms were discovered. About this same time the major calcium release channel in the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane was purified and named the ryanodine receptor [3]. Although the ryanodine receptor represents one of the largest functional proteins, the enormous gene encoding the 5021 amino acids comprising the ryanodine receptor subunit was eventually cloned [4,5]. Patient and dedicated work on the ryanodine receptor gene has found linkage to MH in the pig [6], dog [7], and among several different mutations and MH in unrelated human families [8,9]. Expression of these mutations in HEK cells has resulted in abnormal calcium release [10,11], supporting but not proving a causal basis for MH. In this review each of the areas mentioned above is discussed in detail revealing a wonderful success story that changed the anesthesiologist's \"worst nightmare\" from a syndrome with high mortality and morbidity to a reasonably well managed disease today.

The pathway for intracortical fluid flow response to a step-load was identified in vivo using intramedullary pressure (ImP) and streaming potential (SP) measurements, and allowed the development of a load-induced flow mechanism which considers mechanotransduction and mechanoelectrotransduction phenomena. An avian model was used for monitoring, simultaneously, ImP and SP under axial loading which generated peak strains of approximately 600 microstrain (microepsilon). ImP response to step-load decayed more quickly than SP relaxation, in which multiple time constants were observed during the relaxations. While the initial relaxation of SP showed a decay on the order of 200 ms, ImP decayed on the order of approximately 100 ms. After the initial decay (approximately 200 ms after loading), ImP quickly relaxed to base line, while SP continued to dominate relaxation. It appears that the decay of ImP is indicative of resistive fluid flow occurring primarily in the vasculature and other intraosseous channels such as lacunar-canalicular pores, and that SP represents the fluid flow in the smaller porosities, i.e., lacunar-canalicular system or even microspores.

This research investigates language-general and language-specific properties of the acquisition of argument structure. Ten French preschoolers enacted forty sentences containing motion verbs; sixteen sentences were ungrammatical in that the syntactic frame was incompatible with the standard argument structure for the verb (e.g. *Le tigre va le lion = *The tiger goes the lion). Previous work (Naigles, Fowler &amp; Helm, 1992, 1995; Naigles, Gleitman &amp; Gleitman, 1993) indicated that English-speaking two-year-olds faced with such ungrammatical sentences consistently altered the usual meaning of the verb to fit the syntactic frame (frame compliance) whereas adults faced with the same sentences altered the syntax to fit the meaning of the verb (verb compliance). The age at which children began to perform Verb Compliantly varied by frame and by verb. The current study finds that the level of Verb Compliance in French five-year-olds largely mirrors that of English-speaking five-year-olds. The sole exception is the intransitive frame with an added prepositional phrase (e.g. *Le tigre amène près de la passerelle = *The tiger brings next to the ramp), which elicits a higher level of Verb Compliance among French kindergarteners than among their English learning peers. This effect may be due to the unambiguous interpretation of French spatial prepositions (i.e. next to has both locative and directional interpretations whereas près de supports only the locative interpretation). These data support the conclusion that the acquisition of argument structure is influenced by both language-general mechanisms (e.g. uniqueness, entrenchment) and language-specific properties (e.g. prepositional ambiguity).", "answer": "The higher level of Verb Compliance in French kindergarteners is due to the unambiguous interpretation of French spatial prepositions, specifically \"près de,\" which supports only a locative interpretation, reducing confusion and aiding in maintaining verb compliance.", "covered": false}

Endometrial cancer is believed to have a better prognosis than cervical cancer. However, this is not necessarily true for cases beyond International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III, and advanced endometrial cancer with distant metastases in particular has a poor prognosis. Moreover, there is no established therapy for advanced endometrial cancer. Recently, we treated two patients with endometrial cancer with multiple lung metastases (FIGO stage IVb). Both patients had massive uncontrollable genital bleeding and eventually progressed to anemia. The imminent severe bleeding was considered to be a major reason for exacerbation of their general condition. Therefore, hysterectomy was performed as a counter-measure to improve their general condition. In their postoperative course, the two patients successfully underwent T-J chemotherapy [paclitaxel: 210 m/m2 over 3h; carboplatin: area under the curve (AUC) 5]. Six courses of the regimen were given every 3-4 weeks. Multiple lung shadows in chest X-P and computed tomography (CT) were reduced in number and size after two courses of T-J chemotherapy.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_166_2", "question": "How long does it take the algorithm to generate the planning volume for each soft-tissue sarcoma patient case considered?", "doc_chunk": "Automated planning volume definition in soft-tissue sarcoma adjuvant brachytherapy. In current practice, the planning volume for adjuvant brachytherapy treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma is either not determined a priori (in this case, seed locations are selected based on isodose curves conforming to a visual estimate of the planning volume), or it is derived via a tedious manual process. In either case, the process is subjective and time consuming, and is highly dependent on the human planner. The focus of the work described herein involves the development of an automated contouring algorithm to outline the planning volume. Such an automatic procedure will save time and provide a consistent and objective method for determining planning volumes. In addition, a definitive representation of the planning volume will allow for sophisticated brachytherapy treatment planning approaches to be applied when designing treatment plans, so as to maximize local tumour control and minimize normal tissue complications. An automated tumour volume contouring algorithm is developed utilizing computational geometry and numerical interpolation techniques in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method. The target volume is defined to be the slab of tissue r cm perpendicularly away from the curvilinear plane defined by the mesh of catheters. We assume that if adjacent catheters are over 2r cm apart, the tissue between the two catheters is part of the tumour bed. Input data consist of the digitized coordinates of the catheter positions in each of several cross-sectional slices of the tumour bed, and the estimated distance r from the catheters to the tumour surface. Mathematically, one can view the planning volume as the volume enclosed within a minimal smoothly-connected surface which contains a set of circles, each circle centred at a given catheter position in a given cross-sectional slice. The algorithm performs local interpolation on consecutive triplets of circles. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated based on its performance on a collection of soft-tissue sarcoma tumour beds within various anatomical structures. For each of 15 patient cases considered, the algorithm takes approximately 2 min to generate the planning volume. Although the tumour shapes are rather different, the algorithm consistently generates planning volumes that visually demonstrate smooth curves compactly encapsulating the circles. This general-purpose contouring algorithm works well whether the catheters are all close together, spread far apart in the plane or arranged in a convoluted way. The automatic contouring algorithm significantly reduces labour time and provides a consistent and objective method for determining planning volumes for soft-tissue sarcoma. Further studies are needed to validate the significance of the resulting planning volumes in designing treatment plans and the role that sophisticated brachytherapy treatment planning optimization may have in producing good plans.", "answer": "2 minutes.", "covered": false}

In this paper, Rayleigh wave (RW) acousto-elastic coefficients of an orthotropic material are theoretically determined according to its characteristics, i.e. the density and the secondand third-order elastic constants. Then, these RW acousto-elastic coefficients are directly measured during an experimental stage and a comparison between calculated and measured coefficients is realized.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_390_1", "question": "What is the advantage of using MRP1 as an alternative to MDR1 gene transfer for bone marrow protection?", "doc_chunk": "Chemoprotection and selection by chemotherapy of multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1) transduced cells. Utilization of chemotherapy for treatment of tumors is mainly limited by its hematological toxicity. Because of the low level expression of drug resistance genes, transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) or multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) genes should provide protection from chemotherapy toxicity. Successful transfer of drug resistance genes into hematopoietic cells might allow the administration of higher doses of chemotherapy and, therefore, increase regression of chemosensitive tumors. In addition, this approach can be used to select in vivo transduced cells by their enrichment after administration of cytotoxic drugs. Our group has studied the potential value of MRP1 to protect hematopoietic cells. The interest in the use of MRP1 as an alternative to MDR1 gene transfer for bone marrow protection lies in its different modulation. Indeed, classical P-gp reversal agents, tested in clinic to decrease MDR1 tumor resistance, have little or no effect on MRP1 function. This would allow, in the same patient, the use of reversal agents to decrease P-gp tumor resistance without reversing bone marrow protection of the transduced hematopoietic cells provided by MRP1. We constructed two different MRP1-containing vectors with either the Harvey retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) as promoters and generated ecotropic producer cells. MRP1 transduced fibroblasts were more resistant to doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide and their chemoprotection was increased after selection with chemotherapeutic agents in the presence of glutathione, a co-factor for MRP1 function. Lethally irradiated mice were engrafted with bone marrow (BM) cells transduced with MRP1 vectors (PGK promoter). We demonstrated that high expression of MRP1 in murine hematopoietic cells reduces doxorubicin-induced leukopenia and mortality. In addition, in vivo selection of MRP1-transduced BM cells was achieved following doxorubicin administration and allowed a better chemoprotection after the second chemotherapy cycle.", "answer": "The advantage of using MRP1 over MDR1 for bone marrow protection is that MRP1 function is not affected by classical P-gp reversal agents, allowing these agents to be used to decrease tumor resistance without reversing the protective effect on bone marrow.", "covered": false}

This review examines the observed high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with IBS. The published literature indicates that fewer than half of individuals with IBS seek treatment for it. Of those who do, 50% to 90% have psychiatric disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depression, while those who do not seek treatment tend to be psychologically normal. Both physiologic and psychosocial variables appear to play important roles in the development and maintenance of IBS.

BHT is degraded to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (BHT-CHO) in mammals, as well as in the natural environment such as in water and soils. BHT-CHO has been studied extensively in terms of their potential toxicities. The present investigation was carried out to quantify BHT and BHT-CHO in river, ground, rain and drinking water obtained from several locations in Germany. Apart from the compounds mentioned above, 1,2-bis-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (2-BHT), which is a dimer of BHT, was also detected in the extracts of some ground water samples. The applied analytical method is based on solid phase extraction (SPE) to concentrate trace compounds from water samples followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the extracts. A total of 51 of the respective water samples were used for extraction purposes and analyte recoveries were all &gt; or = 80%. The determination limit for BHT was 5 ng l(-1) and for BHT-CHO 16 ng l(-1). The standard deviations for the analytical procedure were 6% for BHT and 10% for BHT-CHO. The use of the antioxidant BHT in Germany has resulted in water concentrations of 7-791 ng l(-1) in the rivers Rhine, Elbe, Main, Oder, Nidda and Schwarzbach. The degradation product BHT-CHO was also detected in the river water samples at concentrations between 29 and 223 ng l(-1). The concentrations of BHT measured in German rivers are lower compared to values measured in the USA and Japan 20 years ago. In ground water, levels for BHT varied from non-detectable up to 2156 ng l(-1) and for BHT-CHO from non-detectable up to 674 ng l(-1).

In this study, the effect of BCG on telomerase activity was examined in the T24 and J82 bladder cancer cell lines, the ACHN human renal cell carcinoma cell line, and the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. T24 and J82 cells were cocultured with BCG for 5 days. Telomerase activity was measured by telomeric repeat amplification protocol. Cell-cycle phase was determined by FACS analysis. Telomerase activity in all cell lines provided high absorbance. Telomerase activity in BCG-treated T24 and J82 cells was significantly decreased when compared with that in the nontreated cells. On the other hand, telomerase activity did not change in ACHN and PC-3 cells after they had been cocultured with BCG. In BCG-treated T24 cells and J82 cells, apoptotic cells were markedly increased compared with those in the nontreated cells.

The aim of the present study was to search for a sensorimotor marker (i.e., visuopostural tuning) that could be correlated with the severity of motor impairments in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Given that autistic children were previously reported to be posturally hyporeactive to visually perceived environmental motion in comparison with normal control children (Gepner et al., 1995), we sought to determine whether children with Asperger syndrome (AS) would share the same postural hyporeactivity to visual motion. Three autistic children with mild to severe motor impairments, three AS children with soft motor signs, and nine normal control children were tested for overall postural instability and postural reactivity to environmental motion. Results indicate, first, that overall postural instability is significantly reduced in autistic children compared with both AS and normal children. Second, although postural oscillations in the fore-aft axis become more attuned to the oscillation frequency of an immersive dynamic visual display as visual speed is increased, in both control and AS subjects, this is not the case in autistic children. Despite the small number of subjects tested in this study, our data confirm the existence of a visuopostural detuning in autistic children. Third, they argue for a correlation between visuopostural tuning and severity of motor signs in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Finally, they suggest a differentiation between children with autism and children with AS with regard to postural reactivity to fast visual motion.

Ring segments of thoracic aorta were isolated from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and isometric tension development was measured with a force transducer. In aorta, with or without intact endothelium, the contractile responses to potassium chloride (0-120 mM) were comparable between the WKY and the SHR groups. Hypertension did not affect the vasoconstrictive response to norepinephrine (0-10 microM) in vessels with intact endothelium, whereas it attenuated the norepinephrine-induced response in vessels without endothelium.

We have reported recently that mouse liver NK cells and NK1 x 1+ T cells were activated by bacterial superantigens via the IL-12 production from Kupffer cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of staphyloccoccal enterotoxin A (SEA) on human T cells with NK cell markers, CD56 or CD57 (NK-type T cells). After stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with SEA, PBMC produced a large amount of IFN- and acquired a potent antitumour cytotoxicity. The in vitro depletion of either CD56+ TCR NK cells, CD56+ T cells or 57+ T cells from PBMC significantly inhibited the IFN- production from PBMC. When purified NK-type T cells, NK cells and regular T cells were cultured with monocytes and SEA they all produced IFN-, while the IFN- amounts produced by both NK-type T cells were greater than those produced by NK cells. NK cells as well as CD56+ T cells showed cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive K562 cells, whereas both NK-type T cells showed a more potent cytotoxicity against NK-resistant Raji cells than did NK cells. The IFN- production from each population as well as from whole PBMC was greatly inhibited by anti-IL-12 antibody but not by anti-IL-18 antibody.

Atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western world. Vascular occlusion caused by atherosclerosis usually requires invasive treatment, such as surgical bypass or angioplasty. However, bypass graft failure and restenosis limit the usefulness of these procedures, with 20% of patients needing a new revascularisation procedure within 6 months of angioplasty. Numerous pharmacological agents have been investigated for the prevention of restenosis but none has shown undisputed efficacy in clinical medicine. Gene transfer offers a novel approach to the treatment of restenosis because of easy accessibility of vessels and already existing gene delivery methods. It can be used to overexpress therapeutically important proteins locally without high systemic toxicity, and the therapeutic effect can be targeted to a particular pathophysiological event. Promising results have been obtained from many pre-clinical experiments using therapeutic genes or oligonucleotides to prevent restenosis. Early clinical trials have shown that plasmid- and adenovirus-mediated vascular gene transfers can be conducted safely and are well tolerated. Ex vivo gene therapy with E2F-decoy succeeded in reducing graft occlusion rate after surgical bypass in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial. In the future, further development of gene delivery methods and vectors is needed to improve the efficacy and safety of gene therapy.

Poorly controlled longstanding diabetes frequently results in sustained hypertension (HTN) which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, hyperglycemia, per se, causes a reversible rise in blood pressure (BP) and increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS activity may raise BP by promoting inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) and/or nonenzymatic generation of vasoconstrictive prostaglandins from peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Therefore, we hypothesized that antioxidant therapy may enhance the BP-lowering effect of glycemia control with insulin replacement in diabetes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by streptozotocin administration and randomized to untreated, antioxidant-treated (vitamin E-fortified food, tocopherol 5000 U/kg chow and vitamin C-fortified H2O, 1000 mg/L), insulin-treated and insulin plus antioxidant-treated groups. Normal rats fed a regular diet or antioxidant-fortified diet served as controls and monitored for 4 weeks. The diabetic animals showed marked hyperglycemia, HTN, proteinuria, depressed tissue glutathione level and elevated plasma lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA) denoting increased ROS activity. Insulin therapy alone resulted in significant, but incomplete reduction in BP and plasma MDA but not proteinuria. Antioxidant therapy alone had no effect on the measured parameters in either the diabetic or control animals. However, combined insulin and antioxidant therapies normalized BP, plasma MDA and urinary protein in the diabetic animals. As expected, uncontrolled diabetes resulted in glomerular hyperfiltration which was partially reversed by insulin therapy, but was unaffected by antioxidant therapy. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia in the early phase of diabetes was associated with elevated plasma MDA, HTN and proteinuria.

Helicobacter pylori colonization induces inflammation in essentially all hosts, a persistent process that increases the risk of developing distal gastric adenocarcinoma. However, only a small percentage of persons carrying H. pylori develop neoplasia; enhanced risk may be related to differences in expression of specific bacterial products, differences in the host response to the bacteria, or the interaction between host and microbe. H. pylori strains that have the cag pathogenicity island are associated with further increased risk for developing distal gastric cancer; however, host responses to H. pylori, such as altered epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, also may be important in lowering the threshold for carcinogenesis. H. pylori cag+ strains selectively enhance proliferation and attenuate apoptosis in human mucosa compared to cag- strains. However, cag+ strains also induce more severe gastritis, suggesting that host inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and hormones may modulate H. pylori-induced alterations in cellular turnover. In the Mongolian gerbil model of gastric carcinogenesis, apoptosis increases early and transiently following H. pylori infection, but scores progressively decline despite worsening gastric inflammation. Epithelial cell proliferation peaks later and is significantly related to increased gastrin levels, suggesting that epithelial cell growth in H. pylori-colonized mucosa may be mediated by gastrin-dependent mechanisms. An emerging model invoked by these data is one in which H. pylori cag+ strains, in conjunction with host mediators, enhance gastric epithelial cell proliferation but not apoptosis in vivo. The combination of increased proliferation without a concordant increase in apoptosis may therefore contribute to the heightened retention of mutagenized cells, which over decades may increase the subsequent risk for gastric cancer.", "answer": "Increased risk of developing distal gastric adenocarcinoma due to H. pylori colonization is mediated by strain-specific effects on gastric mucosal cellular turnover, particularly those strains with the cag pathogenicity island, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in the presence of severe inflammation.", "covered": false}

It is widely accepted that eating disorders do occur in children. There is a growing literature on childhood-onset AN, and it seems that the core behavioral, psychologic, and physical features are similar to those in adults. The differences between children and adults also must be taken into account, however. Because children have lower levels of body fat, they tend to become emaciated and suffer the effects of starvation for more quickly than adults, which must be taken into account when considering treatment. Although cases of childhood-onset BN have been reported, they are so rare that empirical research is difficult. Clinical features reported regarding the atypical childhood-onset eating disorders generally concur, although empirical testing of these features has yet to be developed. Theories as to why children develop these disorders need further development.

Within the last two decades, various vectors based on human viruses have been developed as gene transfer vehicles for gene therapy applications and vaccination. However, one yet unresolved problem connected to the use of viral vectors in humans is the pre-existing immunity to most of these vectors in the vast majority of the population which can result in impaired gene transfer efficiency and increased secondary toxicity. One approach to solve this problem is the development of recombinant viruses of non-human origin as vectors for gene transfer. The major rationale for using such vectors is the avoidance of vector neutralization by pre-existing antibodies directed against the virus on which the vector is based. Use of vectors based on non-human viruses may therefore allow the use of lower initial vector doses to achieve efficient gene transfer. Side-effects caused by interactions between vectors derived from human viruses with a primed immune system or with blood components could also be reduced. Furthermore, these vectors might show new cell type tropisms and could therefore infect tissue and organs that are not accessible to current viral vectors. This review outlines some of the problems inherent in the human origin of current viral vectors and describes features and progress with non-human adenovirus and baculovirus-derived vectors that may provide alternatives.", "answer": "Using non-human viral vectors could potentially improve gene transfer efficiency by avoiding immune neutralization and expanding the range of accessible tissues.", "covered": false}

While screening a HWTDF site, various factors such as present land use, ecologically sensitive areas, geology and hydrogeology of the area, the quality and quantity of wastes, engineered safeguards, and the operational procedures that need to be adopted. are required to be addressed. In this paper, a multi-level screening criteria employing Remote Sensing, Constraint Mapping, Groundwater Pollution Potential Index (DRASTIC Index), and the Site Ranking was used to assess the suitability of a proposed site for the development of HWTDF.

{"id": "article-24559_18_0", "question": "What are the available treatments for thoracic duct leaks that involve lymphatic fluid?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy, Lymphatic System -- Clinical Significance. Leaks of lymphatic fluid occur when the lymphatic vessels are damaged. In the abdomen, lymphatic vessel damage may occur during surgery, especially during retroperitoneal procedures such as repairing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. These leaks tend to be mild, and the vessels in the peritoneum and mesentery eventually absorb the lymphatic fluid or chyle. However, when the thoracic duct is injured in the chest, the chyle leak can be extensive. In most cases, conservative care with a no-fat diet (medium chain triglycerides) or total parenteral nutrition is unsuccessful. In most cases, if the injury to the thoracic duct was surgical, a surgical procedure is required to tie off the duct. If the thoracic duct is injured in the cervical region, then inserting a drainage tube and adopting a low-fat diet will help seal the leak. However, thoracic duct injury in the chest cavity usually requires drainage and surgery. It is rare for the thoracic segment of the thoracic duct to seal on its own.

The following study presents the postmortem findings in three cases of bee sting fatality, including one in which no observable sting was found. An autopsy approach to such cases is detailed. Overreporting of bee sting-related deaths may occur due to the inclusion of deaths unrelated to a reaction to bee venom, while under-reporting may be due to unexplained deaths where a history of a bee sting is not available or apparent at autopsy. A classification of bee sting-related deaths is proposed, which would allow more accurate reporting of bee sting-related fatalies. A serum tryptase and specific IgE to bee venom on serum obtained at autopsy can assist in confirming anaphylactic reaction to bee venom as the cause of death, particularly in the absence of observable stings. Although there are limitations to the usefulness of serum tryptase tests in the postmortem situation, it may still be useful to confirm suspected anaphylaxis in autopsy cases with an undetermined cause of death.", "answer": "1 to 4", "covered": false}

From August 2000 through January 2001, two King County fire-based emergency medical services (EMS) agencies participated in an alternate care destination program for patients with specific low-acuity diagnosis codes (intervention group). Eligible patients were offered care at a clinic-based destination as an alternate to the ED (n = 1,016). The frequency of the destination of care (ED, clinic, or home) for the intervention group was compared with a matched control group that was comprised of a preintervention historical cohort of EMS encounters from the same two fire-based agencies and with the same acuity and diagnosis criteria and seasonal interval (n = 2,617). Compared with the preintervention group, a smaller proportion of patients in the intervention group received care in the ED (44.6% vs. 51.8%, p = 0.001), while a greater proportion of patients in the intervention group received clinic care (8.0% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.001) or home care (no transport) (47.4 vs. 43.7%, p = 0.043).

Cholestyramine also interferes with the metabolism of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is metabolized mainly in the liver, where it is conjugated to glucuronides and sulfates. These conjugation products then enter the enterohepatic circulation by excretion into the bile. A fraction of conjugated products are deconjugated in the intestine, and free hormones are reabsorbed. In states of thyrotoxicosis, there is increased enterohepatic circulation of thyroid hormone. Cholestyramine decreases the reabsorption of thyroid hormone from enterohepatic circulation.

Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing surfaces in knee and hip prostheses are frequently manufactured by direct compression moulding of the as-polymerised powder. A study was made of the important role of the temperature-time sequence in the melt state during processing, in determining the mechanical integrity of mouldings at 37 degrees C. Structural features were determined by calorimetry (for the degree of crystallinity), infra-red spectroscopy (for the degree of oxidation), density measurement, and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical integrity was assessed by tensile tests at a constant nominal strain-rate of 10(-3) s(-1), with post-failure microscopic examination. For the whole range of melt temperatures 145-200 degrees C and times 10-90 min, essentially the same stress-strain path was followed, reflecting invariance of the degree of crystallinity. However, there were dramatic changes in elongation-to-break, from ca 10% for some mouldings at 145 degrees C to a mean of 560% at 175 degrees C where, at the 86% confidence level, there was evidence for a peak. The rise was explained by microscopy, that revealed two distinct types of fusion defect, of reducing severity with increasing temperature. Type 1 defects were voids arising from incomplete powder compaction, and persisted up to 165 degrees C. Type 2 defects were regions of enhanced deformability at inter-particle boundaries in apparently fully compacted mouldings, evidenced microscopically by localised relative displacements at particle interfaces, during the plastic deformation at 37 degrees C. They persisted up to 200 degrees C. Type 2 defects may be attributed to the slow self-diffusion of UHMWPE in the melt, leading to incomplete homogenisation. even after compaction is complete.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_642_0", "question": "What critical issue revolves around the usefulness of tumor markers in bladder cancer screening and monitoring?", "doc_chunk": "Current concepts of tumor markers in bladder cancer. The critical issue in characterizing the usefulness of tumor markers in screening or monitoring for urothelial cancer and in determining prognosis revolves around the question, \"What do we need to know?\" During surveillance of patients with low-risk disease, highly sensitive markers may detect disease persistence or early recurrence (on the basis of field-effect changes or tumor cell implantation); however, they may not indicate the possibility of progression. If cystoscopy is negative in these instances, is it appropriate to treat? Does earlier treatment actually prevent recurrence or progression? Some investigators have suggested a positive answer to the former question, although lead-time bias may a role. The issue in the latter question may be moot because low-risk disease is by definition unlikely to progress. A corresponding question is whether one should treat the patient if the marker has a low specificity. In such instances, a marker with low specificity may incur more frequent instrumentation and a panoply of additional costs. A marker may have some value in providing earlier diagnosis in low-risk disease if treatments are available to prevent clinical expression and recurrence. A tumor marker would have additional value if it could detect biologic change from low-risk to high-risk disease and permit a corresponding change in treatment. Moreover, if a marker could provide earlier diagnosis in high-risk disease, it might permit identification of those patients likely to progress at earlier and curable stages of disease. To be successful, such markers must have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis. It has been suggested that \"a simple noninvasive highly sensitive and specific method for detecting bladder cancer would decrease the morbidity associated with current surveillance methods, improve quality of life for patients, and reduce costs by substituting a less expensive test for the more expensive endoscopic procedures\" (Dr. M. Soloway, personal communication 2000). In considering this statement, it is tempting to question some of its implications. The term \"simple\" suggests that point-of-care tests may be the easiest, but tests that are available may be inconsistent and not sufficiently sensitive or specific. The need for a \"highly sensitive and specific\" test is of critical importance for applicability in the individual, even when such tests are based on the results in large populations. When considering the \"morbidity of current methods,\" it is tempting to question whether cystoscopy is that morbid a procedure. Given the information it provides, it seems improbable that it can be readily replaced. Currently, no markers provide information over and above that provided by cystoscopy and histology- or cytology-based understanding of the biology of the disease especially in considering distinctions between low-risk and high-risk disease. The ability to \"improve quality of life\" will depend on the use of the predictive value made on the basis of a test's sensitivity and specificity. A false-positive test may lead to anxiety and extensive unnecessary evaluation, whereas a false-negative test may lead to missed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and the possibility of disease progression until accurate diagnosis is obtained. In each case, quality of life is compromised. \"Substituting a less expensive test\" depends on the benefits of that substitution and the practicality of omitting or delaying standard assessment. Costs depend on the frequency of testing, those incurred by false-positive tests, and those incurred by false-negative tests. Several caveats emerge when taking into account these various considerations. In screening for low-risk disease, the urgency of diagnosis may be less important. High sensitivity is of less importance because the risk of a missed diagnosis has less ominous repercussions. Nevertheless, high specificity is important to avoid unnecessary frequent instrumentations. In considering surveillance for low-risk disease, cytology may be more useful in indicating a change from negative (persistent or recurrent low-risk disease) to positive (high-risk disease) with the consequent need for more aggressive treatment approach. No urinary \"screening\" markers reliably provide this information. In considering surveillance for high-risk disease, sensitive markers would detect persistence or early recurrence. If such markers are negative, intervals between repeated cystoscopies may be prolonged; however, a high specificity is needed to ensure the validity of a truly negative interpretation. Otherwise, diagnosis may be missed and the risk from progression and the development of incurability increased. Markers for urothelial cancer must be expressed exclusively as a consequence of the presence of cancer cells. The test must be sensitive in detecting disease and must be validated in nonselected populations. It must be sensitive in excluding nondisease, and noncancer conditions must have little influence on its accuracy. There must be little or no interassay or intra-assay variability. Interpretation of an assay for a tumor marker should be all or none, or based on a threshold level. The assays must have sufficient sensitivity and specificity in populations and in the individual to have practical clinical applicability.", "answer": "The critical issue revolves around the sensitivity and specificity of tumor markers and their impact on treatment decisions and healthcare costs.", "covered": false}

Bupropion SR treatment is effective in the prevention of relapse to smoking in those patients who have successfully quit, and re-treatment is effective in smokers who recommence smoking after a previous course of bupropion SR. Bupropion SR treatment relieves the symptoms of craving and nicotine withdrawal, and attenuates the weight gain that often occurs after smoking cessation. Data collected from motivational support programmes and employer-based studies provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of bupropion SR as an aid to smoking cessation in 'real life' situations, and confirm the efficacy seen in clinical trials.", "answer": "Yes.", "covered": false}

The paper reports on the results of an investigation aimed to evaluate the performances of an innovative tannery wastewater process based on the combining biological degradation, carried out in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor, with chemical oxidation, performed by ozone. The combined treatment was carried out at the laboratory scale on real primary effluent coming from a centralised plant treating the wastewater from a large tanning district in Northern Italy. SBBR performances with and without ozonation were compared resulting to be very satisfactory only in the latter instance where recorded COD, NH4-N and TSS average removals were 97%, 98% and 99.9%, respectively. Such efficiencies correspond to specific concentrations in treated effluent well below the limit values fixed by the in-force Italian regulations. Furthermore, it was proved that the combined process is characterised by a very low sludge production.

It is important to recognize that deeper lacerations are more likely to cause canalicular damage, and the type of object plays a role - glass tends to produce deeper lacerations, while a fist is more likely to cause injury due to shearing forces. Tetanus status should be clarified with the patient, and updated as needed. The identification/removal of foreign bodies and copious irrigation of the wound will work to reduce the risk of infection. CT, or less likely plain film, imaging may be indicated to assess for foreign bodies and underlying facial bone fractures. The source of the injury may indicate the need for additional prophylaxis, i.e., consideration of rabies immunoglobulin or antibiotic coverage in a dog, or cat, bites.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_255_0", "question": "Where can noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) be performed?", "doc_chunk": "Where to perform noninvasive ventilation? Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been shown to be a means of reducing the need for endotracheal intubation, which when effective reduces the complication rate and improves outcome. Because paralysis and sedation are not needed and because the patient is not necessarily dependent upon a machine for respiration, ventilation outside the intensive care unit (ICU) is an option. A number of studies have shown that NPPV for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be effective in the non-ICU environment, though usually in patients with less severe exacerbations. However, there have been no direct comparisons of the application of NPPV in different locations. The likelihood of success of the technique is an important factor in deciding there NPPV should be performed. Ready access to invasive ventilation is important when NPPV is not indicated from the outset or fails after an initial trial. In acute exacerbations of COPD, NPPV is less likely to be successful the more severe the exacerbation, as measured by the severity of acidosis. Good tolerance of NPPV, which translates into an improvement in pH and a fall in respiratory rate, predicts a successful outcome and is a useful way of monitoring progress. NPPV has been shown to be cost effective both in the ICU and when performed on general wards. A dedicated intermediate care unit with particular expertise in noninvasive modes of ventilation may provide the best environment, both in terms of outcome, but also cost effectiveness. The ideal location for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation will vary from country to country and indeed from hospital to hospital, depending upon local factors. However, the most important factor is that staff be adequately trained in the technique and be available throughout the 24-h period.", "answer": "Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) can be performed outside the ICU, in non-ICU environments, general wards, or a dedicated intermediate care unit.", "covered": false}

Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for potentially fatal cases of fulminant hepatic failure. However, it is very difficult to predict which cases will be fatal. The mortality may depend on alternative medical therapies. According to a nationwide survey of patients with fulminant hepatic failure presenting with encephalopathy of a coma grade greater than II within 8 weeks from the first symptoms of illness with a prothrombin time less than 40% of normal value, there were 93 patients in 311 hospitals between January and December 1998 in Japan. During this period, there were 11 patients with late-onset hepatic failure. The etiology was HAV infection in 4%, HBV infection in 44%, and nonA-nonB in 41%. Specific therapies were intensively used in all patients. The mean survival rate was 41%, with differences depending on the etiology. Six patients underwent liver transplantation, and 5 survived. In animal experiments, sinusoidal fibrin deposition caused massive liver necrosis. Activation of Kupffer cells and hepatic macrophages was a major contributing factor of this development. There were different mechanisms of such fibrin deposition. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and superoxide anions released from hepatic macrophages after endotoxin administration destroyed endothelial cells, and then coagulopathy occurred in the sinusoids in rats given Propionibacteriom acnes, while a tissue factor from Kupffer cells played that role in rats undergoing partial hepatectomy. The prognosis of fulminant hepatic failure may depend on the etiology.

Many kinds of technologies have been introduced and successfully developed for therapeutic apheresis. Furthermore, several kinds of these technologies have also been applied in critical care. Double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP), however, is rarely applied in this field in comparison with other treatments such as continuous hemofiltration, continuous hemodiafiltration, single filtration plasmapheresis, and plasma adsorption therapies. In this paper, the characteristics of the DFPP treatments for critical care are summarized. During the DFPP treatments, the patient's blood volume (BV) often decreases with time due to albumin loss induced by inadequate albumin infusion in a supplementation fluid. We examined the change of BV by a continuous hematocrit monitor, Crit-Line, during an in vivo study for 9 patients. As a result, albumin loss fairly occurred in DFPP treatments. The decrease of patient BV was induced by an oncotic pressure drop due to albumin loss and often resulted in a blood pressure drop. This is a serious problem for DFPP in critical care. We should avoid inadequate albumin infusion if the patient is suffering from these adverse effects. In order to determine the optimal concentration C(S) and volume V(S) values of a supplemented albumin solution, we introduced a variable blood volume model for albumin transport in DFPP.", "answer": "continuous hemofiltration, continuous hemodiafiltration, single filtration plasmapheresis, plasma adsorption therapies.", "covered": false}

In a prospective cohort study, serum concentrations of markers of type I collagen synthesis and degradation were assessed monthly for student nurses who worked as nurses for a period of 6 months and compared with those of a reference group. The number of patient-handling activities was estimated from observations at the workplace. Linear generalized estimating equations were used to analyze differences in the serum concentrations of the biomarkers between the exposed group and reference group, as well as to analyze whether the number of patient-handling activities was associated with serum concentrations of the biomarkers. Serum concentrations of the biomarkers were found to differ between the groups. The biomarkers reflected a higher anabolism of type I collagen in the exposed group when compared with that of the reference group. An analysis of the effect of the number of patient-handling activities revealed that a higher exposure was associated with higher effective type I collagen synthesis within the exposed group.

The failure to exhibit adequate secretory function is not due simply to the destruction of neural innervation to the residual glandular elements or the absence of receptors for acetylcholine on the glandular cells. It is likely that release of cytokines by lymphocytes and glandular cells (especially interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha), autoantibodies and metalloproteinases lead to decreased release of neurotransmitters and decreased response of the residual glandular cells to available neurotransmitters.

Mechanisms and relevance of idiosyncratic drug reactions. In adverse drug reactions, effects accounted for by the pharmacological profile of the drug may be distinguished from sometimes bizarre, unpredictable events (\"idiosyncrasies\"). In the majority of cases, the latter are due to reactive intermediates formed by members of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These products are usually formed at very low quantities. However, genetic disposition (e.g. by enhanced expression of the catalyzing enzyme or failure of protective factors such as glutathione) or certain external conditions (for example comedication of inducers of drug metabolism) may lead to toxic intermediates being available at relevant quantities. Once generated, these metabolites will react with macromolecules and finally cause cell necrosis. Necrosis may result from direct damage to functions essential to the cell or be secondary to harmful immune reactions activated by recognition of the new structures as neoantigens. As the principal site of drug metabolism, the liver is most frequently affected by idiosyncratic reactions, which often enough are recognized only after large numbers of patients have been treated. The idiosyncratic potential of a drug relates to its chemical structure rather than its pharmacological mechanism. Risks are evident if biotransformation yields products with chemical substructures such as quinones, phenoles, acyl halides, aromatic and hydroxyl amines. There are numerous cases of precursor drugs with idiosyncratic potential that have been replaced or marginalized by agents with more favorable chemical properties. Examples include beta 1-preferential beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (toxic precursor: practolol) and the choline esterase inhibitors used in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the latter group, tacrine (CAS 321-64-2) gives rise to high liver enzyme levels in about 30% of the patients, an effect not shared with more recent, chemically different entities. A similar case can be made for the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (CAS 97322-87-7) (marketed, now withdrawn in the USA) and its successors rosiglitazone (CAS 122320-73-4) and pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8). Due to its different chemical structure, only troglitazone can be transformed into a reactive quinone metabolite, a process that may be accelerated by the drug inducing its own metabolism. In agreement with this view, there is no evidence of specific hepatic toxicity with the two successor drugs.

Cancer arises as a direct result of genetic mutations. It therefore stands to reason that cancer should be well suited for the correction through gene therapy. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer and the rapid development of recombinant DNA technology have made cancer gene therapy feasible in the clinical setting. The current efforts for cancer gene therapy mainly focus on immunogene therapy, chemogene therapy, restoration of tumor suppressor gene function, and oncolytic virus therapy. Central to all these therapies is the development of efficient vectors for gene delivery--this remains a work in progress. These vectors can be classified as viral and non-viral vectors. This paper will concentrate on viral vectors because of their practical advantages over non-viral vectors. Of the viral vectors, by far the most important are the human adenoviruses as is reflected by the enormous data and literature accumulated by studies relating to animal tumor models and clinical trials. In this review, we examine the recent progress in adenovirus-mediated cancer gene therapy with regard to cytokine gene, tumor suppressor gene, chemogene, and oncolytic adenovirus. We also discuss the current limitations of the adenoviral vector system and how they may be circumvented in future developments relating to targeted gene delivery.", "answer": "Immunogene therapy, chemogene therapy, restoration of tumor suppressor gene function, and oncolytic virus therapy.", "covered": false}

This open clinical study was designed to investigate the occurrence of adverse reactions of specific immunotherapy (SIT) with horse dander and to recognize signs of efficacy regarding horse-induced cutaneous and respiratory symptoms. Twenty-four patients attending our Outpatient Clinic in Huelva (Spain) with horse-induced allergy were selected for receiving a standardized extract of horse dander (Alutard SQ). Local and systemic reactions (five adverse reactions in four patients) were observed during the induction phase of treatment when administering the doses with the highest allergen concentration. Systemic side effects were mild, one immediate case consisting of wheezing and prompt response to treatment and one mild conjunctival hyperemia. Doses were reduced in all cases, and good tolerance to SIT was maintained. The sensitivity of patients to horse dander as assessed by deliberate natural exposure to horse decreased significantly when patients reached maintenance dose: Conjunctivitis symptoms were reduced in all patients, rhinitic symptoms in 93%, asthmatic symptoms in 90%, and cutaneous symptoms in 87% of the patients. Subjective assessment of a patient's allergic disease on a visual analog scale (VAS) showed an improvement. Ninety-five percent of the patients were highly satisfied with the treatment (efficacy, suitability, and troubles).

Tobacco use is the single most important preventable health risk in the developed world, and an important cause of premature death worldwide. Smoking causes a wide range of diseases, including many types of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and peptic ulcer disease. In addition, smoking during pregnancy adversely affects fetal and neonatal growth and development. Recent decades have seen a massive expansion in tobacco use in the developing world and accelerating growth in smoking among women in the developed world. Globally, smoking-related mortality is set to rise from 3 million annually (1995 estimate) to 10 million annually by 2030, with 70% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking are reversible, and smoking cessation treatments represent some of the most cost effective of all healthcare interventions. Although the greatest benefit accrues from ceasing smoking when young, even quitting in middle age avoids much of the excess healthcare risk associated with smoking. In order to improve smoking cessation rates, effective behavioural and pharmacological treatments, coupled with professional counselling and advice, are required.

Triclosan (TCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol) is a widely used antimicrobial agent. To understand its fate during sewage treatment, the biodegradation and removal of TCS were determined in activated sludge. In addition, the effects of TCS on treatment processes were assessed. Fate was determined by examining the biodegradation and removal of TCS radiolabeled with 14C in the 2,4-dichlorphenoxy ring in laboratory batch mineralization experiments and bench-top continuous activated-sludge (CAS) systems. In batch experiments with unacclimated sludge, TCS was mineralized to 14CO2, but the total yield varied as a function of test concentration. Systems that were redosed with TCS exhibited more extensive and faster mineralization, indicating that adaptation was a critical factor determining the rate and extent of biodegradation. In a CAS study in which the influent level of TCS was incrementally increased from 40 microg/L to 2,000 microg/L, removal of the parent compound exceeded 98.5% and removal of total radioactivity (parent and metabolites) exceeded 85%. Between 1.5 and 4.5% of TCS in the influent was sorbed to the wasted solids, whereas &gt;94% underwent primary biodegradation and 81 to 92% was mineralized to CO2 or incorporated in biomass. Increasing levels of TCS in the influent had no major adverse effects on any wastewater treatment process, including chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, and ammonia removal. In a subsequent experiment, a CAS system, acclimated to TCS at 35 microg/L, received two separate 4-h shock loads of 750 microg/L TCS. Neither removal of TCS nor treatment processes exhibited major adverse effects. An additional CAS study was conducted to examine the removal of a low level (10 microg/L) of TCS. Removal of parent equaled 94.7%, and biodegradation remained the dominant removal mechanism. A subsequent series of CAS experiments examined removal at four influent concentrations (7.5, 11, 20, and 50 microg/L) of TCS and demonstrated that removal of parent ranged from 98.2 to 99.3% and was independent of concentration. Although TCS removal across all experiments appeared unrelated to influent concentration, removal was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.87) with chemical oxygen demand removal, indicating that TCS removal was related to overall treatment efficiency of specific CAS units. In conclusion, the experiments show that TCS is extensively biodegraded and removed in activated-sludge systems and is unlikely to upset sewage treatment processes at levels expected in household and manufacturing wastewaters.", "answer": "$TCS is biodegraded in activated sludge treatment primarily through microbial activity, where it undergoes primary biodegradation and mineralization to CO2, with adaptation playing a critical role in the rate and extent of biodegradation.", "covered": false}

Comparisons between responses of control sheep and naturally infested sheep by Western blot analysis suggested that variations in IgG responses of I. ricinus-exposed sheep were mostly associated with specific responses to I. ricinus SGE antigens. Sheep IgG responses were positively related to the numbers of adult ticks feeding per sheep at the time samples were collected, were greater during the spring than the autumn periods of I. ricinus activity and were inversely related to sheep resistance to ticks measured by the weights of nymphal I. ricinus that engorged on the sheep.

The performing physician should perform a surgical scrub and don a sterile gown and double gloves, and not touch the distal portion of the needle that will be entering the disc. Only light sedation, if any, is preferred. This procedure can be performed under local anesthetic or by the additional administration of oral valium to help ensure that the patient is relatively comfortable but not heavily sedated since real-time accurate patient feedback is essential. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the nucleus pulposus of each disc to be tested is entered with the smallest gauge needle possible, typically a 22 or 25 gauge spinal needle. The discs are then sequentially pressurized with contrast, and the patient’s response to pressurization of each disc is noted. If pain reproduced is of adequate severity and similar in quality to the patient’s usual spine pain, the test is deemed concordant; however, if the pain produced is dissimilar to the patient's usual spine pain, the test is discordant.

Utilization of chemotherapy for treatment of tumors is mainly limited by its hematological toxicity. Because of the low level expression of drug resistance genes, transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) or multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) genes should provide protection from chemotherapy toxicity. Successful transfer of drug resistance genes into hematopoietic cells might allow the administration of higher doses of chemotherapy and, therefore, increase regression of chemosensitive tumors. In addition, this approach can be used to select in vivo transduced cells by their enrichment after administration of cytotoxic drugs. Our group has studied the potential value of MRP1 to protect hematopoietic cells. The interest in the use of MRP1 as an alternative to MDR1 gene transfer for bone marrow protection lies in its different modulation. Indeed, classical P-gp reversal agents, tested in clinic to decrease MDR1 tumor resistance, have little or no effect on MRP1 function. This would allow, in the same patient, the use of reversal agents to decrease P-gp tumor resistance without reversing bone marrow protection of the transduced hematopoietic cells provided by MRP1. We constructed two different MRP1-containing vectors with either the Harvey retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) as promoters and generated ecotropic producer cells. MRP1 transduced fibroblasts were more resistant to doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide and their chemoprotection was increased after selection with chemotherapeutic agents in the presence of glutathione, a co-factor for MRP1 function. Lethally irradiated mice were engrafted with bone marrow (BM) cells transduced with MRP1 vectors (PGK promoter).

An 1-year study of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill found that spill residues on the oiled shorelines rapidly lost toxicity through weathering. After 1990, toxicity of sediments remained at only a few heavily oiled, isolated locations in Prince William Sound (AK, USA), as measured by a standard amphipod bioassay using Rhepoxynius abronius. Data from 648 sediment samples taken during the 1990 to 1993 period were statistically analyzed to determine the relationship between the total concentration of 39 parent and methyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (defined as total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [TPAH]) and amphipod mortality and the effect of oil weathering on toxicity. A logistic regression model yielded estimates of the lower threshold, LC10 (lethal concentration to 10% of the population), and LC50 (median lethal concentration) values of 2,600, 4,100, and 10,750 ng/g TPAH (dry wt), respectively. Estimates of the threshold and LC50 values in this field study relate well to corresponding sediment quality guideline (SQG) values reported in the literature. For sediment TPAH concentrations &gt;2,600 ng/g, samples with high mortality values (&gt;90%) had relatively high fractions of naphthalenes and those with low mortality (&lt;20%) had relatively high fractions of chrysenes. By 1999, the median sediment TPAH concentration of 117 ng/g for the post-1989 worst-case sites studied were well below the 2,600 ng/g toxicity threshold value, confirming the lack of potential for long-term toxic effects. Analysis of biological community structure parameters for sediment samples taken concurrently found that species richness and Shannon diversity decreased with increasing TPAH above the 2,600 ng/g threshold, demonstrating a correspondence between sediment bioassay results and biological community effects in the field.

The present study used a directed free-recall procedure (J. J. Dalezman, 1976) and manipulated the frequency composition of the word lists (pure and mixed). Overall, with pure lists, a greater proportion of high-frequency (HF) words were recalled than low-frequency (LF) words, and with mixed lists, a greater proportion of LF words were recalled than HF words. Of importance, this recall advantage for one frequency over the other as a function of list composition was evident across the last three serial positions, indicating an influence of word frequency on recency effects that is dependent on the frequency composition of the lists.

Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) protein, a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta-subunits, prevents mistargeting of nascent polypeptide chains to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. alpha-NAC has sequence similarities with transcription-regulating proteins and has been reported to function as a transcriptional coactivator potentiating c-Jun-mediated transcription. Performing gene hunting using differential display-polymerase chain reaction, a downregulated sequence in the frontal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) with AD-like neuropathology was identified as a-NAC with 100% homology. The significant decrease in alpha-NAC mRNA was shown by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in parallel, the significant decrease of alpha-NAC protein, which was even more pronounced when related to either actin or neuron-specific enolase levels, was also observed in both disorders. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong, significant correlation between alpha-NAC protein and mRNA expression. In fetal DS brain, however, mRNA levels of alpha-NAC were comparable between DS and controls, suggesting that the decrease in alpha-NAC might be involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. The decrease in alpha-NAC as a transcriptional coactivator could contribute to the characteristic decline of the c-Jun-mediated transcriptional machinery and could function as the complementary mechanism in c-Jun-mediated apoptosis. Decreased alpha-NAC may result in the mistargeting, mistranslation, and proteolysis of proteins by affecting overall NAC function.", "answer": "alpha-NAC", "covered": false}

The current performance of analytical techniques used for drug control in horses lead the Regulatory Authorities to decide whether trace levels of drugs legitimately used for therapeutic medication should or should not be reported. Here, we propose a well-ordered and nonexperimental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach for the determination of irrelevant drug plasma (IPC) and urine concentrations (IUC). The published plasma clearance is used to transform an effective (marketed) dose into an effective concentration (EPC). EPC is transformed into an IPC by applying a safety factor (SF). This method is based on several assumptions (eg, drug effects reversibly driven by plasma concentration, linearity of drug disposition). The suitability of the computed IPC and IUC can be checked by calculating the residual amount of drug at IPC and computing a minimal drug withdrawal time. It is concluded that controlling the drug effect (using drug or any analyte concentration as a marker) rather than the drug exposure will be more demanding and also makes urine a less than ideal matrix.", "answer": "Calculating the residual amount of drug at IPC and computing a minimal drug withdrawal time.", "covered": false}

When the ligamentum flavum has penetrated a loss of resistance is felt through the plunger, and the normal saline is injected due to negative pressure upon penetration into epidural space. Firm, careful control of needle depth is vital as syringes are exchanged at this stage to avoid the advancement of the needle. The LOR syringe is exchanged for a syringe containing iodinated contrast, and a small amount is injected to ensure epidural placement. [10] On AP view, an asymmetric, vacuolated contrast spread consistent with epidural placement view should be observed. If the placement is too dorsal due to a false loss of resistance, a dense blotch may is observable suggesting the needle needs to be advanced further using the LOR technique once again. Or, a rapidly dissipating vascular pattern implies arterial injection, and the placement should be adjusted. If the needle has been advanced too far ventrally, a symmetrical, smooth, and faint pattern may be observed suggesting subdural injection. In this case, the clinician should withdraw the needle and an alternative interlaminar site selected.

Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing surfaces in knee and hip prostheses are frequently manufactured by direct compression moulding of the as-polymerised powder. A study was made of the important role of the temperature-time sequence in the melt state during processing, in determining the mechanical integrity of mouldings at 37 degrees C. Structural features were determined by calorimetry (for the degree of crystallinity), infra-red spectroscopy (for the degree of oxidation), density measurement, and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical integrity was assessed by tensile tests at a constant nominal strain-rate of 10(-3) s(-1), with post-failure microscopic examination. For the whole range of melt temperatures 145-200 degrees C and times 10-90 min, essentially the same stress-strain path was followed, reflecting invariance of the degree of crystallinity. However, there were dramatic changes in elongation-to-break, from ca 10% for some mouldings at 145 degrees C to a mean of 560% at 175 degrees C where, at the 86% confidence level, there was evidence for a peak. The rise was explained by microscopy, that revealed two distinct types of fusion defect, of reducing severity with increasing temperature. Type 1 defects were voids arising from incomplete powder compaction, and persisted up to 165 degrees C. Type 2 defects were regions of enhanced deformability at inter-particle boundaries in apparently fully compacted mouldings, evidenced microscopically by localised relative displacements at particle interfaces, during the plastic deformation at 37 degrees C. They persisted up to 200 degrees C. Type 2 defects may be attributed to the slow self-diffusion of UHMWPE in the melt, leading to incomplete homogenisation. even after compaction is complete.

This study assesses the predictive value of conjunctival provocation test in two groups of A. simplex-sensitized subjects and negative controls. Group A consisted of 28 individuals with a clinical history strongly suggestive of gastroallergic anisakiasis and group B, of 32 individuals without such history. The 60 individuals had positive skin tests and in vitro specific IgE determinations to A. simplex. Skin and conjunctival provocation tests were performed with an extract of A. simplex at a concentration of 1 mg of lyophilized material per ml.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_772_2", "question": "Why does a zigzag survey design result in less adequate reconstruction compared to a parallel pattern for both immovable and movable fields?", "doc_chunk": "Patchy distribution fields: a zigzag survey design and reconstruction adequacy. A mathematical model was used to examine the effects of a zigzag survey design on the adequacy of reconstructing patchy distribution fields. The model simulates fish or plankton patches (or gaps) of different shapes and spatial orientations, and an acoustic survey by a set of transects forming a zigzag. Adequacy of the reconstructed fields to those originally generated was evaluated by calculating their correlations (r). A priori information on the autocorrelation radius for the field in the direction of a survey (R) allows optimization of survey design and the algorithm of data analysis. A patchy field can be reconstructed properly (r &gt; 0.80) if the distance between transects D &lt; (1.0-1.5)R. If a priori information on the field is not available, the autocorrelation radius should be determined when reconstructing the field, i.e. a posteriori. In cases of field movement, the criterion for choosing a survey direction is based on the relationship between the dimension of moving patches in the direction of movement and that of the surveyed area. The results obtained indicate that, for a fixed transect spacing, zigzag pattern allow less adequate reconstruction of an original distribution field (in cases of both immovable and movable fields) than corresponding parallel pattern.", "answer": "Less adequate reconstruction with zigzag pattern due to its inefficiency in maintaining consistent transect spacing compared to parallel patterns.", "covered": false}

The important progress achieved in the treatment of prostate cancer comes by exacting significant costs [11, 16-18, 20, 23, 25]. Currently, there is incomplete evidence that the radical interventions at hand significantly reduce the human costs of the disease. Surgery and radiotherapy induce substantial risks of incontinence and impotence. The PSA test has probably decreased the stage at which prostate cancer is diagnosed [15]. Nonetheless, the PSA is a means of earlier detection; it does not elucidate quantitatively distinct modes of treatment. The PSA test is not a means of prostate cancer prevention. The continuing incidence, morbidity, and mortality imposed by this disease strongly indicate that preventive strategies for its control are necessary. Chemoprevention with selenium and other agents offers a promising approach that is undergoing intensive investigation. Randomized trials underway at the authors' center are building on the important clinical trial results reported by Dr. Larry C. Clark. These studies will evaluate the activity of selenium at several points along a continuum ranging from cancerous prostatic tissue in men with diagnosed cancer to premalignant tissue in men with high-grade PIN to healthy tissue in high-risk men with negative biopsy to long-term effects on cancerous tissue in men with frank cancer.

Evidence for this mechanism has surfaced in patients who develop reactive arthritis after salmonella or chlamydia infections, which trigger a specific HLA-B27 CD8 T cell response. The misfolding hypothesis suggests that HLA-B27 may misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing functional alterations in dendritic cell populations and function, increased formation of osteoclasts, and also increased IL-23 production, which has been shown to have pathogenic effect in spondyloarthropathy.

All muscles of the tongue are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve [XII] except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the vagus nerve [X]. The hypoglossal nerve [XII] leaves the skull through the hypoglossal canal and descends almost vertically in the neck to a level just below the angle of the mandible (Fig. 8.263). Here it angles sharply forward around the sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery, crosses the external carotid artery, and continues forward, crossing the loop of the lingual artery, to reach the external surface of the lower one-third of the hyoglossus muscle.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_124_2", "question": "What are some differences in the spectroscopic data between XAD-8 isolates and RO isolates in the surface water natural organic matter study?", "doc_chunk": "A comparison of surface water natural organic matter in raw filtered water samples, XAD, and reverse osmosis isolates. This research compared raw filtered waters (RFWs), XAD resin isolates (XAD-8 and XAD-4), and reverse osmosis (RO) isolates of several surface water samples from McDonalds Branch, a small freshwater fen in the New Jersey Pine Barrens (USA). RO and XAD-8 are two of the most common techniques used to isolate natural organic matter (NOM) for studies of composition and reactivity; therefore, it is important to understand how the isolates differ from bulk (unisolated) samples and from one another. Although, any comparison between the isolation methods needs to consider that XAD-8 is specifically designed to isolate the humic fraction, whereas RO concentrates a broad range of organic matter and is not specific to humics. The comparison included for all samples: weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), polydispersity (rho), absorbance at 280 nm normalized to moles C (epsilon280) (RFW and isolates); and for isolates only: elemental analysis, % carbon distribution by 13C NMR, and aqueous FTIR spectra. As expected, RO isolation gave higher yield of NOM than XAD-8, but also higher ash content, especially Si and S. Mw decreased in the order: RO &gt; XAD-8 &gt; RFW &gt; XAD-4. The Mw differences of isolates compared with RFW may be due to selective isolation (fractionation), or possibly in the case of RO to condensation or coagulation during isolation. 13C NMR results were roughly similar for the two methods, but the XAD-8 isolate was slightly higher in 'aromatic' C and the RO isolate was slightly higher in heteroaliphatic and carbonyl C. Infrared spectra indicated a higher carboxyl content for the XAD-8 isolates and a higher ester:carboxyl ratio for the RO isolates. The spectroscopic data thus are consistent with selective isolation of more hydrophobic compounds by XAD-8, and also with potential ester hydrolysis during that process, although further study is needed to determine whether ester hydrolysis does indeed occur. Researchers choosing between XAD and RO isolation methods for NOM need to consider first the purpose of the isolation; i.e., whether humic fractionation is desirable. Beyond that, they should consider the C yield and ash content, as well as the potential for alteration of NOM by ester hydrolysis (XAD) or condensation/coagulation (RO). Furthermore, the RO and XAD methods produce different fractions or isolates so that researchers should be careful when comparing the compositions and reactivities of NOM samples isolated by these two different techniques.", "answer": "The differences in the spectroscopic data between XAD-8 isolates and RO isolates include higher aromatic carbon content in XAD-8 isolates and higher heteroaliphatic and carbonyl carbon content in RO isolates.

A series of novel N- and 3alpha-modified piperidine-based analogues of cocaine were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit reuptake of DA, 5-HT, and NE by the DA, 5-HT, and NE transporters. N-Demethylation of trans-(+)-3alpha-piperidine-based ligands leads to improved activity at the SERT and NET and modest changes at the DAT. Replacement of the N-methyl group in trans-(+)-ester 1a with phenylalkyl groups leads to a modest 2.3-fold improvement in activity at the SERT (K(i) &lt; or = 3.27 microM), insignificant changes at the NET, and a 3.5-fold loss in activity at the DAT (K(i) &gt; or = 810 nM); however, such replacement in cis-(-)-ester 4, the more potent isomer of 1a, leads, in general, to a significant decrease in activity at all monoamine transporters (K(i) &gt; 1 microM). Other N-modified ligands, including the ligands with polar groups incorporated in the N-alkyl substituent (3e-g) and ligands lacking the basic nitrogen (3i and 6d), show decreased activity at all monoamine transporters, though ligands 3e-g are similar in potency at the NET to 1a. N-Norester 2a, a possible metabolite of the lead compound 1a, and alcohol 1c, a compound with a 3alpha-substituent that is more stable to metabolism than 1a, were selected for further behavioral tests in animals. Alcohol 1c and ester 2a are similar in potency at the DAT to cocaine, ester 1a, and oxadiazole 1b, and both fully substitute for cocaine and have potency similar to that of cocaine in drug discrimination tests. Like cocaine, 1c increased locomotor activity (LMA) monotonically with time, whereas 2a produces biphasic effects consisting of initial locomotor depression followed by delayed locomotor stimulation. An interesting difference between cocaine, ester 1a, alcohol 1c, and N-norester 2a is that 1c and 2a are significantly longer acting in LMA tests. Although this result was anticipated for alcohol 1c, it is rather surprising for 2a which has an ester function susceptible to hydrolysis, a pathway of in vivo deactivation of cocaine and its ester analogues. The present results may have important implications for our understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the behavioral actions of cocaine and of the structural features needed for the design of the new leads in the discovery of a cocaine abuse medication.", "answer": "Improved activity at SERT and NET, modest changes at DAT.", "covered": false}

Sediments may be the ultimate sink for persistent (xeno-)estrogenic compounds released into the aquatic environment. Sediment-associated estrogenic potency was measured with an estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene (ER-CALUX) assay and compared with a recombinant yeast screen. The ER-CALUX assay was more sensitive to 17beta-estradiol (E2) than the recombinant yeast screen, with an EC50 of 6 pM E2 compared to 100 pM in the yeast screen. Yeast cells were unable to distinguish the anti-estrogens ICI 182,780 and (4-hydroxy)tamoxifen, which were agonistic in the yeast. Acetone-soluble fractions of hexane/acetone extracts of sediments showed higher estrogenic potency than hexane-soluble extracts in the ER-CALUX assay. Sediments obtained from industrialized areas such as the Port of Rotterdam showed the highest estrogenic potency of the 12 marine sediments tested (up to 40 pmol estradiol equivalents per gram sediment). The estrogenic activity of individual chemicals that can be found in sediments including: alkylphenol ethoxylates and carboxylates; phthalates; and pesticides, was tested. Increasing sidechain length of various nonylphenol ethoxylates resulted in decreased estrogenic activity. Of the phthalates tested, butylbenzylphthalate was the most estrogenic, though with a potency approximately 100,000 times less than E2. The organochlorine herbicides atrazine and simazine failed to induce reporter gene activity. As metabolic activation may be required to induce estrogenic activity, a metabolic transformation step was added to the ER-CALUX assay using incubation of compounds with liver microsomes obtained from PCB-treated rats.

The resources were priced using Australian dollars ($A) healthcare costs. The outcomes and costs of the new intervention were compared with standard care. Seven published trials involving 1277 patients (54% men; mean age 73 years) were identified. The pooled data showed that overall, a policy of early hospital discharge and domiciliary rehabilitation reduced total length of stay by 13 days [95% confidence interval (CI): -19 to -7 days].

Gp130 mRNA of 9.0 and 7.5 kb were detected in a variety of rat tissues including the testis. Gp130 mRNAs were detected in isolated, immature Sertoli cells. The levels of gp130 were significantly stimulated by the addition of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not by the addition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). IL-6 activates intracellular signaling by binding with a receptor consisting of an 80-kDa ligand-binding protein, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and a second 130-kDa protein, gp130. As previously reported, expression of IL-6R mRNA in rat Sertoli cells was stimulated not only by IL-1-beta and IL-6 but also by FSH. In contrast, gp130 mRNA expression was not stimulated by FSH in our analysis.

The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic efficiency of tumor markers in the diagnosis of lung cancer, by the mathematical evaluation of a tumor marker profile employing fuzzy logic modelling. A panel of four tumor markers, i.e., carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 19 antibody (CYFRA 21-1), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) and, additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP), was measured in 175 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients with different histological types and stages. Results were compared with those in 120 control subjects, including 27 with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), 65 with pneumoconiosis, and 11 persons with acute inflammatory lung diseases. A classificator was developed using a fuzzy-logic rule-based system. Application of the fuzzy-logic rule-based system to the tumor marker values of CYFRA 21-1, NSE, and CRP yielded an increase in sensitivity of approximately 20%, i.e., 92%, compared with that of the best single marker, CYFRA 21-1(sensitivity, 72%).

Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) is a non-pathogenic human parvovirus that is being developed as a gene therapy vector for the treatment of numerous diseases. One property of wild-type AAV-2, that is highly desirable in a gene therapy vector, is its ability to preferentially integrate its DNA into a 4 kilobase region of human chromosome 19, designated AAVS1. One disadvantage of AAV-2 is its relatively small packaging capacity, approximately 4.7 kilobases. Because of this size limitation, the AAV-2 rep and cap genes were removed from first-generation AAV-2-based gene therapy vectors to make room for the therapeutic or marker gene. It was later discovered that the rep gene, or at least one of its products, the Rep68 or Rep78 protein, is required for preferential integration of AAV-2. Recent developments in AAV-2 gene therapy vector construction allow the inclusion of the rep gene into a second generation of AAV-2-based gene therapy systems. These new systems fall into four major categories: plasmid-based systems, co-transduction with multiple AAV-2 vectors, incorporation of the AAV-2 vector into a larger virus, and in vitro packaging.

The current performance of analytical techniques used for drug control in horses lead the Regulatory Authorities to decide whether trace levels of drugs legitimately used for therapeutic medication should or should not be reported. Here, we propose a well-ordered and nonexperimental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach for the determination of irrelevant drug plasma (IPC) and urine concentrations (IUC). The published plasma clearance is used to transform an effective (marketed) dose into an effective concentration (EPC). EPC is transformed into an IPC by applying a safety factor (SF). This method is based on several assumptions (eg, drug effects reversibly driven by plasma concentration, linearity of drug disposition). The suitability of the computed IPC and IUC can be checked by calculating the residual amount of drug at IPC and computing a minimal drug withdrawal time. It is concluded that controlling the drug effect (using drug or any analyte concentration as a marker) rather than the drug exposure will be more demanding and also makes urine a less than ideal matrix.", "answer": "EPC is calculated using the published plasma clearance to transform an effective dose into an effective concentration.", "covered": false}

There has been great improvement in increasing access to various forms of LARC in recent years. However, some barriers remain, especially for nulliparous women and adolescents. There are groups of healthcare providers that have not been fully educated on the use of LARC in nulliparous patients, including adolescents. There is evidence to suggest that these methods should be encouraged in these populations because of their reversibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the barriers that remain for adolescents and nulliparous women include unfamiliarity and/or discomfort with the device, initial cost of device and insertion, lack of parental acceptance, and unfamiliarity of the healthcare provider providing the consultation. However, research has shown that when patients are educated at length on the various forms of contraception available with no worry of cost, 67% of women chose a form of LARC, with 56% choosing an IUD. [19] [Level 3] Therefore, as healthcare providers, it is imperative to stay up-to-date on guidelines for improving access to critical healthcare for patients. For example, there had been studies that showed nulliparous women should not be started on IUDs because of an inherent risk of pelvic inflammatory disorder, leading to future infertility. However, these reports have since been refuted and show that these devices are safe for nulliparous women to use. [34] Various medical societies, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Centers for Disease Control, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Society for Family Planning, support the use of LARC, including IUDs in adolescents.

Pharmacoeconomic studies using claims data are frequently employed to compare the healthcare costs associated with competing drugs. Different methodological approaches with varying limitations for evaluating claims data are reviewed within the context of psychosis. Intent-to-treat paradigms and mirror-image designs have limitations that can bias comparisons of health resource use and can be addressed through the use of drug treatment episodes. Health resource use is better measured in financial rather than volume amounts, to account for service intensity. However, financial measures reported in claims records need to be carefully chosen. Between-group comparisons are frequently affected by selection bias, and within-group comparisons are often limited by period bias. While selection bias can be addressed by controlling for patient factors such as disease severity, and period bias by controlling for trend, devising appropriate control measures from the limited information in claims data can be challenging. Healthcare data are often skewed, which affects statistical testing. While skewed data are commonly handled through log transformation, this method has serious limitations, potentially distorting pharmacoeconomic comparisons.
