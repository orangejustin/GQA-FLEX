The use of logbooks in the education of medical undergraduate students is not well-established. Traditionally, logbooks are used simply as a means for students to document their activities. This report examines whether logbooks used as an interactive vehicle between students and tutors can assist both student learning and Faculty teaching. As part of the New Medical Curriculum implemented by the Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, all third year students beginning their formal hospital and community health clerkships were given pocket-sized logbooks to document and monitor their learning activities. The logbooks were specially designed to mirror the activities of the teaching blocks, including bedside teaching, tutorials, teaching clinics, health care projects, and whole class sessions, etc. At the end of each teaching block, effort, accuracy of the notes, appropriateness of the notes and the assessor's overall impression of logbook entries formed the basis of 20-point assessment. Randomly-selected logbooks were reviewed at the end of every rotation and compared with course outlines in order to evaluate if, according to the students' notes, the learning objectives were being met. Throughout each teaching block, the logbook process identified students who could benefit from counselling and/or remediation. The logbook feedback mechanism was immediate and therefore, remediation was timely and appropriate. The logbooks were effective in 3 ways: logbooks were a means of continuous assessment of small group learning; logbooks encouraged immediate and ongoing interaction between tutors and students; and they provided a feedback loop for the evaluation of learning activities.", "answer": "The benefits of using interactive logbooks for medical students in the context of small group learning and tutor feedback include continuous assessment of learning, enhanced interaction between tutors and students, and a feedback loop for evaluating and improving learning activities.", "covered": false}

The palatopharyngeus is innervated by the vagus nerve [X]. The pharyngeal fascia is separated into two layers, which sandwich the pharyngeal muscles between them: A thin layer (buccopharyngeal fascia) coats the outside of the muscular part of the wall and is a component of the pretracheal layer of cervical fascia (see p. 991). A much thicker layer (pharyngobasilar fascia) lines the inner surface. The fascia reinforces the pharyngeal wall where muscle is deficient. This is particularly evident above the level of the superior constrictor where the pharyngeal wall is formed almost entirely of fascia (Fig. 8.203). This part of the wall is reinforced externally by muscles of the soft palate (tensor and levator veli palatini).

Metal adsorption and surface charge determinations were performed previously on well-characterised Sphagnum and Carex peat samples. The aim of this investigation was to determine metal adsorption from complex wastewaters onto these peat samples and compare it to the adsorption onto peat granules, clinoptilolite, glauconite and a flue dust from steel production. A sulphide mine leachate, a landfill leachate and a laundry wastewater were chosen, giving a variation in pH, ionic strength, total organic carbon and concentrations of metals. Metal adsorption was determined in batch and column experiments. The wastewater composition was of great importance for metal removal efficiency, mainly due to the difference in dominating metal species. In the sulphide mine leachate, containing free metal ions, a high metal adsorption was observed onto both peat and inorganic adsorbents. In the landfill leachate the metals formed carbonate and organic complexes and a low metal removal was achieved. Contrary to the leachates, the laundry wastewater contained suspended particles. The high amount of metals removed, 80% of the Cu and 30-60% of the Zn concentration, was probably withdrawn bound to the particle fraction. The highest removal of metal ions was obtained in the sulphide mine leachate with Carex peat, removing 97-99% of the Zn and 85-100% of the Cu content. The Sphagnum peat sample removed 37-77% of the Zn and 80-100% of the Cu content. The differences found between Sphagnum and Carex peat were attributed to the original chemistry of the plant material and the habitat conditions at the time of peat formation. Generally, the combination of glauconite or clinoptilolite with the peat samples in column experiments gave a minor improvement in metal removal.", "answer": "Sulphide mine leachate with Carex peat.", "covered": false}

We investigated how selected electromorphological parameters of myelinated axons influence the preservation of interspike intervals when the propagation of action potentials is corrupted by axonal intrinsic noise.

The strategy of this coding supposes that interspike intervals presented to higher order neurons would minimally be deprived of information included in interspike intervals at the axonal initial segment. Our experiments were conducted using a computer model of the myelinated axon constructed in a software environment GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System). We varied the axonal diameter, myelin sheath thickness, axonal length, stimulation current and channel distribution to determine how these parameters influence the role of noise in spike propagation and hence in preserving the interspike intervals. Our results, expressed as the standard deviation of spike travel times, showed that by stimulating the axons with regular rectangular pulses the interspike intervals were preserved with a microsecond accuracy.

Within the last two decades, various vectors based on human viruses have been developed as gene transfer vehicles for gene therapy applications and vaccination. However, one yet unresolved problem connected to the use of viral vectors in humans is the pre-existing immunity to most of these vectors in the vast majority of the population which can result in impaired gene transfer efficiency and increased secondary toxicity. One approach to solve this problem is the development of recombinant viruses of non-human origin as vectors for gene transfer. The major rationale for using such vectors is the avoidance of vector neutralization by pre-existing antibodies directed against the virus on which the vector is based. Use of vectors based on non-human viruses may therefore allow the use of lower initial vector doses to achieve efficient gene transfer. Side-effects caused by interactions between vectors derived from human viruses with a primed immune system or with blood components could also be reduced. Furthermore, these vectors might show new cell type tropisms and could therefore infect tissue and organs that are not accessible to current viral vectors. This review outlines some of the problems inherent in the human origin of current viral vectors and describes features and progress with non-human adenovirus and baculovirus-derived vectors that may provide alternatives.", "answer": "The advantages of using non-human adenovirus and baculovirus-derived vectors for gene therapy include avoidance of pre-existing immunity, potential for lower initial vector doses, reduced side effects, and new cell type tropisms.", "covered": false}

Seizures occur when a disruption in the stability of the neuronal membrane leads to hyperexcitability. For example, hyponatremia alters the ion concentration surrounding the neuronal membrane, decreasing the intracellular to extracellular gradient; this affects the neuron's stability, which can lead to hyperexcitability of neurons. Withdrawing from certain medications (eg, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) causes GABA A, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, to be sensitized, thus leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. Hypoglycemia alters neuronal metabolism and impairs subcellular function. Abnormalities affecting any central nervous system component (eg, ions, receptors, cells, networks, or brain regions) can lead to seizures.

Tobacco use is the single most important preventable health risk in the developed world, and an important cause of premature death worldwide. Smoking causes a wide range of diseases, including many types of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and peptic ulcer disease. In addition, smoking during pregnancy adversely affects fetal and neonatal growth and development. Recent decades have seen a massive expansion in tobacco use in the developing world and accelerating growth in smoking among women in the developed world. Globally, smoking-related mortality is set to rise from 3 million annually (1995 estimate) to 10 million annually by 2030, with 70% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking are reversible, and smoking cessation treatments represent some of the most cost effective of all healthcare interventions. Although the greatest benefit accrues from ceasing smoking when young, even quitting in middle age avoids much of the excess healthcare risk associated with smoking. In order to improve smoking cessation rates, effective behavioural and pharmacological treatments, coupled with professional counselling and advice, are required.

The pathway for intracortical fluid flow response to a step-load was identified in vivo using intramedullary pressure (ImP) and streaming potential (SP) measurements, and allowed the development of a load-induced flow mechanism which considers mechanotransduction and mechanoelectrotransduction phenomena. An avian model was used for monitoring, simultaneously, ImP and SP under axial loading which generated peak strains of approximately 600 microstrain (microepsilon). ImP response to step-load decayed more quickly than SP relaxation, in which multiple time constants were observed during the relaxations. While the initial relaxation of SP showed a decay on the order of 200 ms, ImP decayed on the order of approximately 100 ms. After the initial decay (approximately 200 ms after loading), ImP quickly relaxed to base line, while SP continued to dominate relaxation. It appears that the decay of ImP is indicative of resistive fluid flow occurring primarily in the vasculature and other intraosseous channels such as lacunar-canalicular pores, and that SP represents the fluid flow in the smaller porosities, i.e., lacunar-canalicular system or even microspores.

However, the detailed pathological function of the PDC-E2 gene is as yet unclear. In order to study the gene function in knockout and transgenic mouse models, we cloned and characterized the mouse PDC-E2 (mPDC-E2) gene. Because the expression level of PDC-E2 was elevated in PBC bile duct cells, we tried to construct a bile duct carcinoma cell line that overexpressed PDC-E2 as a PBC cell model. The mPDC-E2 cDNA was obtained by the 3'Race method. We overexpressed this gene in KMBC cells, using a retrovirus vector. The transcript and translated protein of mPDC-E2 were detected by Northern blot and Western blot, respectively. The deduced amino-acid sequence from the cloned cDNA indicated that the fully mature protein consisted of 557 amino-acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 59kD.

For Stomoxys landing on adult cattle, only 27% took a full meal (mean feeding time = 147 s). Most Stomoxys left the host before completing their meal, largely due to disturbance by the host's defensive behaviour (24%, mean time = 59 s) or other flies (44%, 71 s). The probability of a Stomoxys leaving the host progressively increased with time. Simultaneous observations of tsetse showed that, compared to Stomoxys, their feeding success was lower (15%), feeding was interrupted earlier (33 s) and the time taken to complete a meal was shorter (109 s). Further studies of tsetse across different seasons and hosts showed that feeding success varied according to host age (adult = 7%; calf = 3%) and was negatively correlated with the frequency of host defensive behaviour and the relative abundance of non-biting Diptera. Disturbances were more often caused by host behaviour (69%) than other flies (31%) and the probability of tsetse leaving decreased with time on the host. Overall, these results suggest that tsetse and Stomoxys have different feeding strategies.

Adjuvant locoregional radio-immunotherapy (RIT) represents a new therapeutic approach. We present our initial experience with this therapeutic tool with respect to adverse effects, biokinetics and clinical follow-up. Following surgery and radiotherapy, 12 patients with glioma (4, WHO stage III; 8, WHO stage IV) underwent 1-5 RIT-cycles (average dose 1100 MBq 131labelled monoclonal BC-4 antibodies) at six week intervals. Follow-up included serial FDG-PET and MRI investigations. Evaluation of biokinetics included whole body scans, together with analysis of blood, urine and fluid from the tumor cavity. Following RIT, four patients experienced temporary seizures, which, in one case, were associated with temporary aphasia. Eight patients developed HAMA (human anti-mouse antibodies) during follow-up. Mean biologic half-life of the radiopharmaceutical in the resection cavity was 3.9 d (range: 1.0-10.2 d) and remained stable intraindividually during further RIT-cycles.

Protocol A involved obtaining basal maximal expiratory flow/volume curves and interrupted curves through a fast valve from 36 asthmatic patients. Maximal flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (V'max50) increase (deltaV'max50) was compared between basal curves and envelope curves passing through SF peaks obtained after each interruption. Protocol B involved the study of 33 asthmatic patients after salbutamol administration and 12 asthmatic patients after methacholine challenge.

Symptoms of atopic asthma often disappear around puberty. The authors recently demonstrated that this clinical remission is accompanied with ongoing airways inflammation in most subjects.

In the present study, young adults in clinical remission of atopic asthma assigned themselves a modified Borg score during methacholine and adenosine-5'-monophosphate induced bronchoconstriction. Borg scores of subjects in clinical remission were compared with those of symptomatic asthmatic subjects. A marked variation in the Borg scores at a 20% fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second was found. Significant differences in Borg scores between remission patients and asthmatics could not be detected. It was concluded that perception of dyspnoea, induced with methacholine and adenosine challenge, is similar in young adults in clinical remission of atopic asthma compared to that of patients with symptomatic asthma.

This paper describes a hypothesis related to the neurochemical background of sleep-waking mental activity which, although associated with subcortical structures, is principally generated in the cerebral cortex. Acetylcholine, which mainly activates cortical neurons, is released at the maximal rate during waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreaming stage. Its importance in mental functioning is well-known. However, brainstem-generated monoamines, which mainly inhibit cortical neurons, are released during waking. Both kinds of influences contribute to the organized mentation of waking. During slow wave sleep, these two types of influence decrease in intensity but maintain a sufficiently high level to allow mental activity involving fairly abstract pseudo-thoughts, a mode of activity modelled on the diurnal pattern of which it is a poor reply. During REM sleep, the monoaminergic neurons become silent except for the dopaminergic ones. This results in a large disinhibition and the maintained dopamine influence may be involved in the familiar psychotic-like mental activity of dreaming. Indeed, in this original activation-disinhibition state, the increase of dopamine influence at the prefrontal cortex level could explain the almost total absence of negative symptoms of schizophrenia during dreaming, while an increase in the nucleus accumbens is possibly responsible for hallucinations and delusions, which are regular features of mentation during this sleep stage.", "answer": "Acetylcholine", "covered": false}

To truly understand the pathophysiology of pulsus paradoxus, we must explore the normal respirophasic effects of chest mechanics on blood pressure. In healthy individuals, there are normal phasic changes in cardiac output that occur with respiration. During inspiration, there is a small decrease in systemic arterial pressure of less than 10 mm Hg. As we inhale, intrapleural pressure drops; there is a decrease in intrathoracic pressure that promotes venous inflow into the chest increasing right heart filling. However, this does not equate to an increased filling of the left heart during inspiration. This is because, as one inhales, the lungs expand and pull radial traction on the pulmonary vasculature increasing its capacitance, momentarily sequestering blood in the chest, and dropping blood flow to the left heart, decreasing pre-load and consequently cardiac output. The opposite occurs during expiration, thus systolic pressure normally decreases during inspiration and increases during expiration. So why does the term pulsus paradoxus imply the drop in blood pressure during inspiration is paradoxical?

CD44 splice variants are assumed to have a critical role in the malignant progression of many human tumors. However, the clinical significance of CD44 expression is not yet understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of expression of CD44s and CD44v6 isoforms in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottic larynx. CD44s and CD44v6 expression was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 101 patients. There was a significant correlation between decreased CD44s or CD44v6 expression and a poorer histologic differentiation. No relationship was observed with T stage or nodal metastasis. Decreased CD44s expression, but not CD44v6 expression, correlated with increased recurrence rates. There was no correlation between the decreased expression of any isoform tested and survival. These data confirm a reduction of CD44s and CD44v6 expression in poorly differentiated tumors. However, these changes do not offer a useful adjunct to current prognostic indicators.", "answer": "Decreased CD44s or CD44v6 expression correlates with poorer histologic differentiation.", "covered": false}

Orthotopic liver transplantation is a life saving and life enhancing procedure. The development of immunosuppressive drugs has contributed to the high rate of success in terms of both patient and graft survival. However, the considerable adverse effects of these therapies are affecting long-term outcomes of transplant recipients. Complications related to immunosuppression are responsible for the majority of deaths in patients surviving more than 1 year. Therefore, the search for an optimal immunosuppressive regimen has become of paramount importance. The liver has proved to be an 'immunologically privileged' organ, capable in several animal models to be accepted as an allograft without any intervention on the immune system of the recipient. In some human liver allografts acceptance of the new organ is recognised after withdrawal of immunosuppressants, but prior identification of such individuals is not yet possible, thus negating this management option. Graft-recipient interaction is peculiar in liver transplantation: acute cellular rejection does not always need to be treated, and if it is not severe, appears to be associated with a better survival of both patient and graft. In the last decade there has been an evolution of immunosuppressive protocols, driven by empirical observation and a deeper understanding of immunological events after transplant. However, most modifications have been made because of the necessity to reduce long-term drug related morbidity and mortality. Withdrawal of corticosteroids has proven to be safely achievable in most patients, with no deleterious effects on patient or graft survival but with a great benefit in terms of reduction of incidence of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Long-term 'steroid-free' regimens are therefore now widely used. Patients with stable graft function can be easily maintained using a single drug usually after 6 or 12 months and usually with a calcineurin inhibitor. The more evolved step of using monotherapy ab initio has also proven to be effective in a few studies and needs to be explored further. In the future new strategies will be designed to help the development of tolerance of the allograft, selectively stimulating instead of suppressing the immune reaction of the recipient.", "answer": "The strategy for immunosuppression in liver transplantation for patients with stable graft function involves maintaining them on a single-agent regimen, typically a calcineurin inhibitor, usually after 6 or 12 months post-transplant.", "covered": false}

The aminosalicylate balsalazide is a prodrug which is metabolised by bacterial azo reductases in the colon to release its therapeutically active moiety mesalazine [mesalamine (US) or 5-aminosalicylic acid] and an inert carrier molecule. The systemic absorption of balsalazide and its metabolites is not required for the therapeutic efficacy of the drug, and has been demonstrated to be limited. Data from well designed trials with a duration of 8 to 12 weeks show that oral balsalazide 6.75 g/day is as effective as (two trials) or more effective than (one trial) oral delayed-release (pH-dependent) mesalazine 2.4 g/day and appears to be as effective as oral sulfasalazine 3 g/day in the treatment of active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. In addition, balsalazide appears to have a faster onset of action than mesalazine. Furthermore, balsalazide was as effective as delayed-release mesalazine (dosages used were 1.2 and 1.5 g/day, where 1.6 g/day is recommended) and oral sulfasalazine 2 g/day (recommended dosage) in the prevention of relapse in ulcerative colitis in remission after 6 to 12 months of treatment; the balsalazide dosage was 3 g/day versus mesalazine and 2 g/day versus sulfasalazine.

Access to a well-trained workforce is one of many factors underscoring the global health divide that separates industrialized and developing nations. This paper describes the distribution and physician output of the world's medical schools, compares regional physician to population ratios, examines population trends and points out potential mismatches between output and anticipated demographic changes. This paper has used multiple data sources in published and electronic form from organized medicine, international health institutions and the medical literature. In addition, a stratified, random survey of 130 medical schools was conducted to determine annual numbers of graduates. Tracking the number and distribution of medical schools and their student capacity is a complex task. The number of medical schools and the estimated number of graduates per population vary by region. In areas of predicted substantial population growth, the production of physicians is neither adequate to meet future needs, nor sufficient to overcome low physician-population ratios. Regions with high physician-population ratios and either expected population decline or small population gains over the next 50 years appear to have an over-capacity to train medical students. This paper emphasizes the need for new methods of tracking the global pipeline of medical education and of establishing ways of sharing expertise. The growing interdependence of nations, accentuated by globalization of the world's economies, our shared goal of achieving health for all and the migration of physicians across borders highlight the need to understand the global capacity to educate the next generation of physicians.", "answer": "Tracking the number and distribution of medical schools is important for planning the future healthcare workforce to ensure the production of physicians meets anticipated healthcare needs based on demographic changes and population growth.", "covered": false}

Beta-lactamases are the most widespread resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics and are an increasing menace to public health. Several beta-lactamase structures have been determined, making this enzyme an attractive target for structure-based drug design. To facilitate inhibitor design for the class C beta-lactamase AmpC, binding site \"hot spots\" on the enzyme were identified using experimental and computational approaches. Experimentally, X-ray crystal structures of AmpC in complexes with four boronic acid inhibitors and a higher resolution (1.72 A) native apo structure were determined. Along with previously determined structures of AmpC in complexes with five other boronic acid inhibitors and four beta-lactams, consensus binding sites were identified. Computationally, the programs GRID, MCSS, and X-SITE were used to predict potential binding site hot spots on AmpC. Several consensus binding sites were identified from the crystal structures. An amide recognition site was identified by the interaction between the carbonyl oxygen in the R1 side chain of beta-lactams and the atom Ndelta2 of the conserved Asn152. Surprisingly, this site also recognizes the aryl rings of arylboronic acids, appearing to form quadrupole-dipole interactions with Asn152. The highly conserved \"oxyanion\" hole defines a site that recognizes both carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. A hydroxyl binding site was identified by the O2 hydroxyl in the boronic acids, which hydrogen bonds with Tyr150 and a conserved water. A hydrophobic site is formed by Leu119 and Leu293. A carboxylate binding site was identified by the ubiquitous C3(4) carboxylate of the beta-lactams, which interacts with Asn346 and Arg349. Four water sites were identified by ordered waters observed in most of the structures; these waters form extensive hydrogen-bonding networks with AmpC and occasionally the ligand. Predictions by the computational programs showed some correlation with the experimentally observed binding sites. Several sites were not predicted, but novel binding sites were suggested. Taken together, a map of binding site hot spots found on AmpC, along with information on the functionality recognized at each site, was constructed. This map may be useful for structure-based inhibitor design against AmpC.", "answer": "The hydroxyl binding site on AmpC is defined by the O2 hydroxyl in boronic acids hydrogen bonding with Tyr150 and a conserved water molecule.", "covered": false}

To explore a static intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique of a more homogeneous isodose distribution to an irregular-shaped tumour of the ethmoid sinus, with concomitantly sparing the adjacent critical normal organs including the orbit. We conducted a static IMRT technique adding 2 or smaller complementary boost-fields to the underdosed volume in the PTV, which resulted from complete blocking of the orbits in all coplanar or non-coplanar main ports of the standard 3-D CRT. The standard 3-D CRT plans (Plan A) and IMRT plans adding complementary boost fields (Plan B) were established for 10 patients with ethmoid sinus cancer. Two sets of different plans for each patient were compared using isodose distribution, dose statistics, and dose volume histogram (DVH) of the planning target volume (PTV) and also using dose statistics and DVH of the adjacent critical structures. The IMRT plans adding 2 or more complementary boost-fields (Plan B) for each patient demonstrated better coverage and improved dose homogeneity of the PTV compared to the standard 3-D CRT plan (Plan A). Moreover, the radiation doses to adjacent normal tissue organs, such as the orbits, optic nerves, brain stem and optic chiasm were similarly spared in both plans. With concomitantly sparing the surrounding visual pathway structures, our IMRT technique using the complementary boost-fields was quantitatively better than current standard 3-D CRT technique with respect to the dose homogeneity within the PTV.

The putative enteropathogen Aeromonas caviae (Proteobacteria: Aeromonadaceae) may be present in faeces of humans and livestock. Recently A. caviae was detected in houseflies by PCR and isolated by culture methods. In this study, we assessed the vector potential of houseflies for A. caviae relative to multiplication and persistence of the bacterium in the fly and to contamination of other flies and food materials. In experimentally fed houseflies, the number of bacteria increased up to 2 days post-ingestion (d PI) and then decreased significantly 3 d PI. A large number of bacteria was detected in the vomitus and faeces of infected flies at 2-3 d PI. The bacteria persisted in flies for up to 8 d PI, but numbers were low. Experimentally infected flies transmitted A. caviae to chicken meat, and transmissibility was directly correlated with exposure time. Flies contaminated the meat for up to 7 d PI; however, a significant decrease in contamination was observed 2-3 d PI. In the fly-to-fly transmission experiments, the transmission of A. caviae was observed and was apparently mediated by flies sharing food. These results support houseflies as potential vectors for A. caviae because the bacterium multiplied, persisted in flies for up to 8 d PI, and could be transmitted to human food items.", "answer": "High", "covered": false}

A new concept of cardioprotection based on the exploitation of endogenous mechanisms is known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). It has been hypothesized that substances released during brief ischemic stress (e.g. catecholamines) stimulate the receptors and trigger multiple cell signaling cascades. Opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels [K(ATP)] has been suggested as a possible final step in the mechanisms of protection. In this study, the role of adrenergic activation was tested in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to test ischemia (TI; 30 min occlusion of LAD coronary artery) by: 1) mimicking IPC (5 min ischemia, 10 min reperfusion) with short-term (5 min) administration of norepinephrine (NE, 1 microM), 15 min prior to TI; 2) blockade with beta- or alpha1-receptor antagonists, propranolol (10 microM) and prazosin (2 microM), respectively, applied 15 min prior to TI during IPC. The role of K(ATP) opening was examined by perfusion with a K(ATP) blocker glibenclamide (10 microM) during IPC. Both IPC and NE-induced PC effectively reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) to 33% and 37%, respectively, vs 100% in the non-PC controls, whereby ventricular fibrillation (VF) was totally abolished by IPC and markedly suppressed by PC with NE (0% and 10%, respectively, vs 70% in the non-PC hearts; P &lt; 0.05).

Protection was not suppressed by propranolol (VT 28%; VF 14%; AS 2.2 +/- 0.6), whereas prazosin reversed the protective effect of PC (VT 83%; VF 67%; AS 4.0 +/- 0.8). Antiarrhythmic protection afforded by NE-PC was abolished by pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin (25 microg/kg, i.p.) given 48 h prior to the experiments. Glibenclamide did not suppress the IPC-induced protection. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the rat heart to ischemic arrhythmias can be modulated by IPC.

However, the resource limitations, especially for developing countries, often dictate that the detailed EA be restricted to those sites, which are constraint free and have low hazard potentials. Thus, a preliminary screening exercise for assessing the suitability of site for developing the HWTDF needs to be carried out to avoid huge costs involved in detailed EA. While screening a HWTDF site, various factors such as present land use, ecologically sensitive areas, geology and hydrogeology of the area, the quality and quantity of wastes, engineered safeguards, and the operational procedures that need to be adopted. are required to be addressed. In this paper, a multi-level screening criteria employing Remote Sensing, Constraint Mapping, Groundwater Pollution Potential Index (DRASTIC Index), and the Site Ranking was used to assess the suitability of a proposed site for the development of HWTDF. The study helped to identify various constraints at the proposed site and their significance on the development of the HWTDF.", "answer": "Factors considered during the preliminary screening for a hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility site include present land use, ecologically sensitive areas, geology and hydrogeology of the area, the quality and quantity of wastes, engineered safeguards, and operational procedures.", "covered": false}

Despite decades of investigation into the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI), the diagnostic process is still quite complex because the majority of patients with chest pain fall in the low or medium risk category with atypical symptoms and nonspecific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Cardiac biochemical markers play an important role in helping physicians make the diagnosis and stratify the risk to patients. However, the ideal cardiac marker and the best diagnostic approach to patients with chest pain in the Emergency Department (ED) remain elusive. Currently, among many cardiac markers, cardiac troponin I seems the most cardiac-specific in the diagnosis of acute MI. This article is focused on reviewing the characteristics of different cardiac markers and comparison of their usages in the diagnosis of acute MI. However, since this field is large and rapidly expanding, it is impossible to cover every aspect of cardiac markers. As the search for the most efficacious, specific and cost-effective means to approach patients with chest pain continues, further prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are needed to confirm the value of troponins and other diagnostic strategies in the early diagnosis of acute MI.", "answer": "Prospective, randomized, multicenter trials.", "covered": false}

Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA, is thought to be necessary for cellular immortality and carcinogenesis. Telomerase activity is associated with the majority of malignant human cancers. The mRNA that encodes the telomerase catalytic subunit (human telomerase repeat transcriptase; hTERT) has recently been identified, and the expression of the hTERT gene is thought to regulate the activation of telomerase. However, the expression of hTERT mRNA in esophageal tissues has not been reported. We investigated hTERT gene expression in cancerous and noncancerous esophageal tissues, and determined the relationship between hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity. Tissues from esophageal carcinomas in 14 patients, reflux esophagitis in 12 patients, esophageal acanthosis in 2 patients, esophageal papilloma in 1 patient, radiation esophagitis in 1 patient, and normal esophageal epithelium in 11 patients (including 3 specimens of normal epithelium from patients with esophageal carcinoma) were examined. All specimens were taken endoscopically. hTERT gene expression was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Quantitative analysis of telomerase activity was analyzed by fluorescence telomeric repeat amplification protocol (F-TRAP) assay. Thirteen of the 14 (93%) esophageal carcinoma specimens expressed hTERT mRNA and revealed detectable telomerase activity. Noncancerous esophageal lesions had not only hTERT mRNA expression with a high frequency (14 of 16 cases; 88%) but also detectable telomerase activity (12 of 13 cases; 92%). Normal esophageal epithelium also highly expressed hTERT mRNA (10 of 11 cases; 91%) and revealed detectable telomerase activity (all 9 cases; 100%). In 32 of the 35 specimens analyzed for both hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity (91%), the expression of hTERT mRNA was consistent with detectable telomerase activity. The expression of hTERT mRNA was detected not only in cancerous but also in noncancerous esophageal tissues at a high frequency. This result was different from that reported for other gastrointestinal epithelium. Moreover, telomerase activity in esophageal carcinoma was significantly stronger than that in reflux esophagitis and normal epithelium. In addition, there was a strong relation ship between the detection of telomerase activity and the expression of hTERT mRNA in cancerous and noncancerous esophageal tissues. Thus, the qualitative analysis of hTERT mRNA expression may not be useful as a biomarker of carcinoma in esophageal tissues. Nevertheless, the quantitative analysis of telomerase activity may be somewhat useful.", "answer": "The relationship between hTERT gene expression and telomerase activity in esophageal tissues is strong, as evidenced by the consistent presence of hTERT mRNA expression alongside detectable telomerase activity in both cancerous and noncancerous tissues.", "covered": false}

Three series of uniaxial tension and compression tests were conducted on two conventional and two highly crosslinked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylenes (UHMWPEs) all prepared from the same lot of medical grade GUR 1050. The conventional materials were unirradiated (control) and gamma irradiated in nitrogen with a dose of 30 kGy. The highly crosslinked UHMWPEs were gamma irradiated at room temperature with 100 kGy and then thermally processed by either annealing below the melt transition at 100 degrees C or by remelting above the melt transition at 150 degrees C. The true stress-strain behavior of the four UHMWPE materials was characterized as a function of strain rate (between 0.02 and 0.10 s(-1)) and test temperature (20-60 degrees C). Although annealing and remelting of UHMWPE are primarily considered as methods of improving oxidation resistance, thermal processing was found to significantly impact the crystallinity, and hence the mechanical behavior, of the highly crosslinked UHMWPE. The crystallinity and radiation dose were key predictors of the uniaxial yielding, plastic flow, and failure properties of conventional and highly crosslinked UHMWPEs. The thermomechanical behavior of UHMWPE was accurately predicted using an Arrhenius model, and the associated activation energies for thermal softening were related to the crystallinity of the polymers. The conventional and highly crosslinked UHMWPEs exhibited low strain rate dependence in power law relationships, comparable to metals.

In this preliminary study, a new approach to ion-exclusion chromatography is proposed to overcome the relatively poor conductivity detection response which occurs in ion-exclusion chromatography when acids are added to the eluent in order to improve peak shape. This approach, termed vacancy ion-exclusion chromatography, requires the sample to be used as eluent and a sample of water to be injected onto a weakly acidic cation-exchange column (TSKgel OApak-A). Vacancy peaks for each of the analytes appear at the retention times of these analytes. Highly sensitive conductivity detection is possible and sharp, well-shaped peaks are produced, leading to efficient separations. Retention times were found to be affected by the concentration of the analytes in the eluent, and also by the presence of an organic modifier such as methanol in the eluent. Detection limits for oxalic, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 microM, respectively, and linear ranges for some acids extended over two orders of magnitude.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are transcription factors that mediate cytokine and growth factor induced signals that culminate in various biological responses, including proliferation and differentiation. Recent studies indicate a role for STATs in apoptosis as well. Depending upon the particular stimulus or cell type, STATs can mediate either pro-apoptotic signals or anti-apoptotic signals. STAT1 and, under some circums-tances. STAT3 are important for transducing pro-apoptotic signals whereas STAT3 and STAT5 have been implicated in promoting cell survival. Recent studies demonstrate that regulation of apoptotic pathways by STATs is largely due to transcriptional activation of genes that encode proteins that mediate or trigger the cell death process, such as Bcl-xL, caspases, Fas and TRAIL as well as those that regulate cell cycle progression, such as p21waf1. Interestingly, STAT proteins may also regulate apoptosis through a non-transcriptional mechanism by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein NF-kappaB.

Lead concentrations in tree rings of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sampled at a parkland in north-west England were measured in wood formed since the mid-1800s. Concentrations of Pb in Scots pine and oak peaked in wood formed between 1900 and 1940, most likely because of Pb accumulation in heartwood, indicating that oak and Scots pine are unsuitable for monitoring temporal changes in Pb deposition at the study site. In contrast, Pb concentrations in sycamore, a species that has similar heartwood and sapwood chemistry, were relatively constant in wood formed between the mid-1800s and 1950. Lead concentrations decreased steadily in sycamore tree rings formed after the 1950s, and decreased more abruptly in wood formed after 1985. This sharp decrease in wood Pb cannot be due to decreases in soil Pb concentration. Stable Pb isotope analysis was used to further investigate Pb patterns in sycamore wood. Excess 206Pb/207Pb ratios in tree-rings of sycamore were relatively constant, approximately 1.17, in wood formed prior to the 1930s, but decreased steadily thereafter reaching a minimum value of approximately 1.16 in wood formed between 1975 and 1985 after which time 206Pb/207Pb ratios increased. This pattern is consistent with changes in Pb isotope ratios measured in peat, sediment and aerosol samples in the UK. However, the magnitude of the decrease in 206Pb/207Pb (largely due to gasoline Pb) is considerably lower than in other studies and our estimates indicate that less than 20% of the total Pb in sycamore wood measured since the mid-1800s is derived from gasoline emissions. A more likely explanation for the pattern of Pb observed in sycamore tree rings is that soil Pb accumulates within rings of the diffuse porous wood over a number of years. Such uptake patterns would result in lower Pb concentrations in the outer (more recently formed) tree rings, which coincide with recent reductions in Pb deposition in the UK.

In 7 patients with abdominal obesity (OB, aged 24-42 yr, BMI: 29.1-43.9 kg/m2, waist/hip ratio [WHR]: 0.86-1.00) we studied the GH, ACTH and F responses to the im administration of glucagon (0.017 mg/kg at 0 min). The results in OB were compared with those in a group of 6 age-matched controls normal subjects (Ns aged 26-32 yr, BMI 19.7-22.5 kg/m2). In Ns glucagon administration induced clear increase in GH (peak vs baseline, mean+/-SE: 11.6+/-3.4 vs 3.3+/-0.7 microg/l, p&lt;0.02), and ACTH (52.9+/-15.2 vs 19.0+/-1.5 pg/ml, p&lt;0.02) levels which peaked at +150 and +165 min, respectively.

Many patients, however, remain severely disabled and we will need to develop new strategies in which the focus will be on reversing impairments rather than simply helping patients to adapt to unaltered impairments. For this to happen, neurological rehabilitation research will have to develop therapies that have a clearly defined rationale and are rooted in neurosciences, are clinically described, are addressed to a well-characterized target population and are evaluated using appropriate outcome measures. Few studies at present meet all these criteria.

Exposure to cat allergen is a major risk factor for sensitization and the development of asthma in many parts of the world. The study was designed to examine the levels of cat allergen (Fel d 1) in homes of two German cities and to detennine predictors of Fel d 1 exposure. We collected dust samples from 405 randomly selected homes in Hamburg (n = 201) and Erfurt (n = 204). In each apartment dust samples were taken from living room floor (LR), bedroom floor (BR), and mattress surface (MA) using vacuum sampling and analyzed by two-site monoclonal antibody ELISA. Environmental variables were assessed by questionnaire to obtain information on factors supposed to have an impact on the Fel d 1 levels in house dust. The effects of possible predictors of Fel d 1 were assessed by multiple linear regression models. Fel d 1 was present in 98% of the homes (395/405), ranging from 0.015 to 7.278 microg/g dust (GM 0.486 microg/g). The levels were similar in floors (GM for LR 0.575 microg/g and BR 0.469 microg/g) and in MA (GM 0.424 microg/g). Higher allergen concentrations (&gt; 2 microg/g) were detected in 99% of the homes keeping cats, in 55% of homes that had had a cat during the last year, and in 28% of the homes without a cat.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown aetiology. Increased oxidant burden and antioxidant, e.g. glutathione (GSH), deficiency in the lower respiratory tract have been thought to play a role in the progression of IPF. Sputum induction is a safe noninvasive tool to study inflammation in the respiratory tract. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct measurement of GSH in induced sputum supernatant. Sixteen IPF patients and 15 healthy, nonsmoking subjects underwent sputum induction. Total GSH in sputum, saliva and plasma was measured spectrophotometrically. Sputum GSH was decreased more then four-fold in IPF patients when compared to healthy subjects (mean GSH 1.4+/-0.34 microM versus 5.8+/-0.98 microM). Salivary GSH was generally low or undetectable in all subjects. Plasma GSH levels were lower in IPF patients (0.26+/-0.1 versus 0.74+/-0.16 microM). In IPF patients, there was a borderline correlation of sputum GSH levels with disease duration and lung-function impairment.

Also, a greater initial inflammatory response was seen in ponies. Based on these experimental data, it was hypothesised that accidental wounds in ponies would heal with a lower incidence of wound dehiscence and/or sequestrum formation compared to horses. A retrospective study of 89 ponies and 422 horses with traumatic wounds was performed. The animals, wounds and treatments were categorised and related to the success rate of primary closure and to the incidence of sequestrum formation. The ponies and horses were of similar age and sex. The wounds that were treated were comparable for localisation, duration, degree of contamination and depth in both groups of animals, but there were significantly more cases with ruptured extensor tendons in ponies.

Antibacterial resistance patterns of isolates were not correlated with bacterial species or strain source. A high number of bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin. erythromycin, and furazolidone, as well as an important frequency of bacterial resistance to florfenicol, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found. On the contrary, the proportion of bacteria resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, flumequine and enrofloxacin was rather low.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of the newly developed low field MRI with the proven methods X-rays and 3P-Sz. 65 patients (47f, 18m; 20-86 yrs) were studied on a one day protocol with 3P-Sz (550 MBq Tc-99m DPD), MRI and X-rays of the hands. Images were visually analysed by two blinded nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists and classified as a) RA-typical, b) inflammatory, non-RA-typical and c) non inflammatory changes. All methods were compared to 3P-Sz as golden standard. In comparison to 3P-Sz, low field MRI presents with almost equal sensitivity and specificity in rheumatoid-typical and inflammatory changes. Conventional X-rays revealed in arthritis-typical changes as well as in inflammatory changes a significantly lower sensitivity and also a lower negative predictive value while specificity equals the one of MRI. Quantitative analysis of 3P-Sz using ROI-technique unveiled significantly higher values in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in those with no inflammatory changes.

Chemical nociception refers to a nociceptive neuron that expresses receptors capable of detecting noxious, irritating, or harmful chemicals. [3] Since heat-sensitive TRPV receptor proteins are also capable of detecting many noxious chemicals, it should be no surprise that the TRP receptor family also function as chemical receptors. In terms of chemical sensitivity TRPV1 is surpassed by TRPA1, while ‘V' indicated vanilloid, ‘A' simply indicates subfamily A. TRPV1 is capable of binding capsaicin, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and other important pro-inflammatory molecules, however TRPA1 is capable of detecting a wide variety of oily and pungent isothiocyanate compounds such as mustard oils, cinnamaldehyde, and formaldehyde, which is commonly injected to study the activity of TRPA1 receptors, and is even responsible for mediating the stinging, tearful sensations induced by chopping onions or exposure to synthetic tear gases. [1] [2] [3] TRPA1 receptor activation also differs significantly from TRPV1 activation, whereas TRPV1 undergoes a conformational change when bound by its ligand, noxious chemicals bind to TRPA1 via a nucleophilic attack that produces covalent modification of cysteine residues on the intracellular portion of the receptor. [3] Once the intracellular modification has occurred, the receptor opens and depolarizes the neuron. [3] The acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) are another example of a noxious chemical receptor, as their name implies ASICs are stimulated by protons that activate the receptor, inducing their cation channel to open. [5] ASIC receptors are found throughout the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) and are capable of detecting acidic conditions of many different etiologies; these conditions span from the more benign lactic acidosis triggering muscle pain to the more severe acidosis produced by the tissue damage induced by ischemia, stroke, or tumor growth.

A training set of 27 propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) analogues was used to construct four-dimensional (4D) quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for three screens of biological activity: loss of righting reflex (LORR) in tadpoles, enhancement of agonist activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor, and direct (agonist-independent) activation of the receptor. The three resulting 4D-QSAR models are almost identical in form, and all suggest three key ligand-receptor interaction sites. The formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bond involving the proton of the ligand -OH group is the most important binding interaction. A hydrophobic pocket binding interaction involving the six-substituent is the second most significant binding site, and a similar hydrophobic pocket binding interaction near the two-substituent is the third postulated binding site from the 4D-QSAR models. A test set of eight compounds was used to evaluate the tadpole LORR 4D-QSAR model. Those compounds highly congeneric to the training set compounds were accurately predicted. However, compounds exploring substituent sites and/or electronic structures different from the training set were less well-predicted.

Etanidazole is characterized by intracellular glutathione depletion and glutathione transferases inhibition, thereby enhancing sensitivity to radiation. It is also cytotoxic to tumor cells and can chemosensitize some alkylating agents by activating their tumor cell killing capabilities.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common viral infection of squamous epithelial tissues, but its importance has only recently been recognised by the medical community. HPVs are now realised to consist of many genotypes and are associated with a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations. Within the genital tract, some diseases have been recognised since antiquity; for example, genital warts which are caused by HPV types distinct from those causing genital cancer. However, others (such as cervical cancer), although recognised centuries ago as linked to sexual activity, have only been associated with oncogenic HPVs relatively recently, with the tools of molecular biology. We now understand that genital HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted viral infections, are largely transient, asymptomatic and of no consequence. This virus manifests as more than just benign warts. Chronic carriage of with oncogenic genotypes (over years and in a minority of patients), together with other cofactors (host and/or exogenous) in complex pathways not totally understood, result in severe dysplasia or, ultimately, carcinogenesis. As it takes time for precursor lesions to develop and there are effective screening programmes for their detection and treatment, HPV-related neoplastic disease of the cervix is largely a preventable reproductive health issue of women. Yet, on a global scale, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of women, with the majority of cases occurring in developing countries. Although HPV is noncultivatable by traditional diagnostic virological methods, successfully applied molecular biology techniques have underpinned development of vaccines which are now in phase II/III clinical trials.

About 20% of patients who are chronically infected with the virus develop cirrhosis about 20-30 years after the infection, with hepatocellular carcinoma developing in about 5% of patients a year. The only drug that effectively reduces the virus is interferon, but complete eradication of the virus can be obtained in only 30%-40% of treated patients. Reevaluation of the predictive factors to eradicate the virus by 24-week interferon therapy showed that the genotype other than 1b, a low virus load, and multiple amino acid substitutions in the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) of genotype 1b are statistically significant predictive factors. Amino acid substitution in the PePHD domain of the E2 protein was rare and was unrelated with the outcome of interferon therapy. The fluctuation of the virus titer measured by branched DNA during a 2-year observation period was less that 10-fold in most patients, and amino acid substitutions in the ISDR were rare in such patients, suggesting that one point measurement of these parameters may be useful to select candidates for interferon therapy. A comparison of patients treated with interferon and untreated patients from the viewpoint of cancer prevention showed only a slight decrease in the risk of treated patients developing hepatocellular carcinoma. However, patients who showed normal alanine amino-transaminase (ALT) irrespective of virus clearance showed a significantly reduced risk of liver carcinogenesis.

The surgical and endovascular treatment options were explained to the patient. Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been, for many years, an operative procedure where the dilation (ballooning) of the aorta is resected and a graft is sewn into position. A modern option is to place a graft to line the aneurysm from within the artery (endovascular aneurysm repair). In this technique the surgeon dissects the femoral artery and makes a small hole in it. The graft is compressed within a catheter and the catheter is passed through the femoral artery and the iliac arterial system into the distal abdominal aorta. The graft can then be released inside the aorta, effectively relining it to prevent further expansion of the aneurysm. Occasionally the relined aneurysm may continue to enlarge after the endovascular graft has been placed and a cause needs to be identified.", "answer": "Endovascular aneurysm repair differs from traditional operative procedures in that it uses a less invasive method, inserting a graft via a catheter through the femoral artery to line the aneurysm from within, rather than resecting the aneurysm and sewing a graft into place.", "covered": true}

The uptake of cadmium was found to be slightly greater than that of zinc and the sorption capacity increases with increase in temperature. The adsorption studies were carried out both in single- and multi-component systems. Adsorption data on derived carbon follows both the Freundlich and Langmuir models. The data are better fitted by the Freundlich isotherm as compared to Langmuir in both the single- and multi-component systems. Isotherms have been used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters. The kinetics of adsorption depends on the adsorbate concentration and the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent. Studies were conducted to delineate the effect of temperature, initial adsorbate concentration, particle size of the adsorbent and solid-to-liquid ratio.

Providing resources depends on the definitions of a specific pathogen-free (SPF) macaque, a B virus-free macaque, and a serologically negative macaque. Many colony managers define a B virus-free macaque in light of the serologic status of the breeding colony, because virus identification is a more complex issue. The lack of a standardized definition of a B virus-free macaque is compounded by the fact that all assays inherently result in some false antibody-positive or -negative data, and reconciliation is equivocal. Long-term follow-up of a colony in which elimination of B virus is actively being attempted will necessarily result in a relatively small sample within the population being incorrectly categorized with regard to antibody status. The goal of this study was to determine whether serially collected serologic data demonstrated patterns that could be used to predict whether an animal was genuinely in the process of B virus antibody seroconversion.

We studied hepatic iron overload (HIOL) patterns in 32 patients who underwent liver biopsies and testing for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D). Iron-stained biopsy specimens were examined for patterns of iron deposits: hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) pattern or non-HH pattern. Visual iron grade based on amount of cellular and lobular iron was evaluated. We found the HH pattern in 17 biopsy specimens (53%) and the non-HH pattern in 6 specimens (19%). HH with superimposed non-HH was noted in 9 cases (28%). In 25 patients with HFE mutations, HH alone and combined with non-HH patterns was noted in 22 specimens (88%). Visual iron grade correlated approximately with the hepatic iron index. Heavy HIOL was noted in C282Y homozygotes and 1 patient with cirrhosis without either HFE mutation. Mild steatohepatitis was found in 21 specimens (66%); it was associated with the non-HH pattern in 80% (12/15) and the HH pattern in 62% (16/26) of cases.

Sodium carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases are preferred over sodium hydroxide for anion analysis by suppressor-based ion chromatography (IC). Unlike hydroxide, carbonate-hydrogencarbonate has strong eluting power and its buffering capacity can be used as a selectivity tool for controlling separations. However, carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases fell out of favor for trace level analysis because the carbonic acid suppressor effluent has some background conductivity, which reduces sensitivity compared to sodium hydroxide. This paper describes a new suppressor technology that improved anion analysis with carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases. In addition to converting the carbonate-hydrogencarbonate buffer to carbonic acid like other traditional IC suppressors, the new DS-Plus suppressor also removed carbonic acid from the suppressor effluent.

Attempts to improve the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies have led to the development of innovative strategies that combine the high specificity of antibody molecules with the efficient trafficking properties and effector functions of immune cells. These antigen-selective cell therapies are designed to convert therapeutically important native antigens expressed on the cell surface (tumor associated antigens, viral envelope proteins) into recruitment points of effector functions, and address the goal of major histocompatibility complex- and exogenous cytokine-independent activation of mature effector T-cells. The most promising and best characterized antigen-selective strategy is based on the genetic manipulation of the recognition specificity of T-cells by grafting the recognition specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a lymphocyte triggering molecule (TCR-associated polypeptides, Fc epsilon RI-gamma chain). Upon encountering specific antigen, cells harboring chimeric immune receptors (CIRs) are able to undergo specific stimulation and kill antigen bearing cells in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Initial studies have focused on terminally differentiated effector cell-based protocols. However, recent data indicate that progenitor cell-based therapies allow the permanent generation of stable populations of CIR-expressing cells of multiple lineages, leading to long-term persistent systemic immunity. Emerging gene therapy strategies are based on the use of biespecic antibody fragments.

Chromium is a primary drinking water contaminant in the USA with hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), being the most toxic form of the metal. As a required step in developing a revised state drinking water standard for chromium, the California Department of Health Services recently issued a new Public Health Goal (PHG) of 2.5 microg/l for total chromium and 0.2 microg/l for Cr(VI). Hexavalent chromium can be determined (as chromate) by ion chromatography, as described in US Evironmental Protection Agency Method 218.6; however, the method as originally published does not allow sufficient sensitivity for analysis at the California PHG level of 0.2 microg/l. Modification of the conditions described in Method 218.6, including the use of a lower eluent flow-rate, larger reaction coil, and larger injection volume, significantly increases the method sensitivity. The modified method, which uses IonPac NG1 and AS7 guard and analytical columns, an eluent of 250 mM ammonium sulfate-100 mM ammonium hydroxide operated at 1.0 ml/min, a 1000 microl injection volume, and postcolumn reaction with 2 mM diphenylcarbazide-10% methanol-0.5 M sulfuric acid (using a 750 microl reaction coil) followed by UV-Vis detection at 530 nm, permits a method detection limit for chromate of 0.02 microg/l.

Understanding the biomechanical effect of various factors on knee behavior after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or reconstruction is instrumental for the development of an optimal surgical treatment of ACL injury that can better restore normal knee function. This paper presents the application of a three-dimensional (3D) computational knee model for parametric studies of knee kinematics in response to simulated muscle loads. The knee model was constructed using the magnetic resonance images and biomechanical experimental data of the same cadaveric human knee specimen. The kinematics of the knee predicted by the computational model was compared with that measured from different specimens in a wide range of loading conditions and flexion angles. In general, the model predictions were within the range of experimental data. The model was then used to predict knee motion, ligament forces, and contact pressure in response to a simulated quadriceps force when the knee was ACL deficient. Partial ACL injury was simulated by reducing the stiffness of the ACL in the model. The results demonstrated that even with a reduction of 75% of the ACL stiffness, the ACL still carried a significant amount of the load (more than 58%) carried by an intact ACL. The kinematics (both tibial translation and rotation) varied less than 20% compared to that of the knee with intact ACL. The 3D computational model can be a powerful tool to simulate different variables that would influence knee function after ACL reconstruction, such as the initial tension of the ACL graft, the insertion sites of the graft, multibundle grafts, graft materials, and various physiological loading conditions.", "answer": "Partial ACL injury was simulated by reducing the stiffness of the ACL in the computational model.", "covered": false}

Two phase III trials were conducted using docetaxel (Taxotere), administered every 3 weeks, as second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In the TAX 317 trial, 204 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (49 received 100 mg/m2 and 55 received 75 mg/m2) or best supportive care (100 patients). Median survival was 7.5 months with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75) vs 4.6 months for best supportive care (P = .010); and 1-year survival was 37% for D75 vs 11% for best supportive care (P = .010). Quality-of-life analysis also showed statistically significant improvement in disease-related symptoms with docetaxel vs best supportive care. In the TAX 320 study, 373 patients were randomized to receive docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 (D100), docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75), or a control arm of either vinorelbine (Navelbine) or ifosfamide (Ifex) (V/I).

Ever since the first decades of the 20th century, some authors have given respiratory infection triggered by bacteria an etiologic role in bronchial asthma, focusing on infection and the asthmatic response. In 1995 our group already presented a study in this sense on nasal secretion cultures and the relationship between IgE and sensitization to allergens. There is a significant association between patients with sensitization to Dermatophagoides, high levels of total IgE, and positive culture to Staphylococcus aureus. Following studies by Norn, we performed a study with 40 children, aged 2-14 years, where we observed that children with sensitization to mites and a positive culture had higher levels of histamine release than did children with negative culture and controls, the differences being significant. We also found, like other authors, that the joint presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Derrmatophagoides pteronyssinus potentiates antigen-specific histamine release. In recent years, with the increasing prevalence of bronchial asthma being studied, the role that infection could play in this increase is being considered again among other factors. As participants of the ISAAC project and using the same methods as in this study, we performed a simultaneous questionnaire with questions related with triggering and contributing factors, etc., including respiratory infection. We found an association between having had more than three episodes of \"bronchitis\" with fever and lasting for longer than seven days in the last year and having ever had asthma (OR 29.09). This association is still greater with having had wheezing in the last 12 months (OR 43.26), a finding that it is also associated with requiring attention in an emergency room (OR 30.65). From these results, we concluded that respiratory infection is an aggravating factor of asthma, something we already knew. In order to have our own experience, we studied serum interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) in a sample of 41 children aged 3 to 17 years. The most frequent values of IL-4 ranged between 0.25 and 0.40 ng, and very low dispersion was found in the sample, which did not allow correlation with other parameters. Regarding IFNgamma, we found values between &lt; 5 pg/ml and 605 pg/ml. When we studied children under treatment with antigen-specific immunotherapy, we observed mean values of IFNgamma of 115.86 pg/ml, whereas the ones who did not follow this treatment or had followed it for less than one year had a mean of 66.06 pg/ml, these differences being significant (p = 0.035), and proving a Th1 response to immunotherapy. This significance is not found if children who have been under immunotherapy for less than one year are included. When we studied children with bacterial immunotherapy, we found that the mean IFNgamma value in children under immunotherapy for longer than one year was 56.4 pg/ml, whereas in children with no immunotherapy it was 101.75 pg/ml (p = 0.034).

Recent improvements in retroviral transduction protocols have resulted in the first successful amelioration of a human hematologic disease--a form of severe combined immunodeficiency--by HSC gene transfer. However, continued advances in gene transfer technology are necessary if the inherent promise of HSC gene therapy is to be fully realized. Ongoing efforts are focused on modifying oncoretroviral vector designs and pseudotyping with alternative envelope proteins. In addition, because of their ability to transduce non-divided cells, safety-modified human immunodeficiency virus-1-based lentiviral vectors have emerged as promising tools for gene modification of HSCs, which reside primarily in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Irrespective of these advances, accumulated data indicate that stably integrated transgenes are frequently subject to position-effect variegation and extinction of expression. Therefore, the extent to which genetic control elements such as chromatin domain insulators and scaffold/matrix attachment regions in conjunction with posttranscriptional regulatory elements will result in enhanced probability and level of transgene expression is under active investigation.

In recent years generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has become a much better defined disorder, with specific criteria distinguishing it from the other anxiety disorders; however, it still lacks the same public and scientific interests as some of the other anxiety disorders such as panic and social phobia. Nevertheless, refinement in the treatment of GAD is becoming more evident through the conduct of clinical trials. Up until the mid-1980's, treatment consisted primarily of benzodiazepines. However, as a result of growing characterisation of their abuse potential, other therapeutic options were explored. Benzodiazepines became seen as an effective short-term therapy, and buspirone and some of the newer antidepressants have become the treatment of choice for patients with GAD requiring long-term treatment. Buspirone was the first available alternative to the benzodiazepines in the US; however, the initial excitement over this agent was somewhat dampened because of its mild efficacy combined with a slow onset of action. The antidepressants were seen as beneficial for the treatment of GAD because of the high comorbidity with depression, thus allowing a better outcome for these patients. The antidepressants that offer both a good adverse effect profile and efficacy are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including paroxetine, and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine. Clinicians should also consider the potential benefits of psychotherapy as an adjunct to medication. There are a number of potentially new pharmacotherapies being investigated, including newer serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists, cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, neurokinin receptor antagonists, gabapentin and its analogues, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor modulators.

In the current study, L-708,906 (10e) and 5CITEP (13b), which are two examples of ADK inhibitors that have been reported by Merck and Shionogi pharmaceutical companies, served as model ADK leads. Structural variations to both the \"left\" and \"right\" sides of these molecules were made in order to examine effects on HIV-1 integrase inhibitory potencies. It was found that a variety of groups could be introduced onto the left side aryl ring with maintenance of good ST inhibitory potency.

One of the reasons I was never asked to write a textbook chapter on it. To critically consider the public opinion/consensus on SS formulated by opinion leaders and textbook chapters. Although our clinical work is based on evidence-based medicine, it is obvious that we do not have evidence-based solutions to the etiology and pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In spite of this, consensus if often taken as a truth, which may hamper the production, funding and/or publication of new and original ideas and views. Comparison of the classic view with one of the many other possible views. The consensus view states that 1) SS is initiated and/or caused by an exogenous agent, probably some type of retrovirus, and 2) after initiation, a straightforward sequence of events follows: a) salivary gland epithelial cells are disrupted, b) T lymphocytes migrate to and are activated in the glands, c) B cells get the help they need and start to produce SS and RF autoantibodies, which processes lead to structural destruction and loss of acinar cells and, thus, to sicca symptoms (an example of the linear, step-by-step \"computer\" logic). The problems inherent to this view include: 1) why women? (gender aspect), 2) why at the age of 50? (chronobiologic aspect), 3) is the normal immune system in SS only responding to normal (formely sequestrated) autoantigens? Is the loss of exocrine gland function really caused by \"autoimmune\" destruction? - or do the SS-autoantibodies and lymphocyte infiltrates only represent markers in an appropriate HLA background? (autoimmune aspect), 4) are the retroviral diseases really similar to SS? (exogenous rs endogenous causes), 5) is our current view compatible with unexpected, future findings? Is the textbook interpretation the final truth (evolutionary aspect of our view on pathogenesis). The tubuloalveolar exocrine glands may be seen as 1) locus minoris resistentiae for normal oral microbial flora and immune-inflammatory attacks at the normal environment-host interface. Apoptotic and/or necrotic cells are released into the intraluminal space and pass in normal glands through normal, immunologically competent lymphocyte foci and/or ectopic lymphatic tissue. Acinar cell degeneration/death may increase upon 2) aging and acinar cell renewal and well-being may be hampered by age-dependent deficiencies in the trophic 3) neuro-endocrine support. In a proper immunogenetic setting, a) marker autoantibodies (e.g. RF, SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La), useful in the diagnosis, are produced. However, sicca symptoms/SS develop only if muscarinic receptor or other b) pathogenetic autoantibodies disrupting the normal neuronal-to acinar cell communication are also produced. c) Systemic symptoms could be produced on neuroendocrine, chronobiologic and autoimmune basis.

The objective of this investigation was to study the thickness and morphology of the calcified cartilage layer of the distal metacarpus over a range of ages. A parasagittal slab of bone was sectioned from the region of sesamoid contact on the medial condyle of the metacarpi from 34 horses. The slab of bone was preserved, dehydrated and embedded, undecalcified, in methylmethacrylate and then stained with toluidine blue. Six repeatable fields of interest from the distal aspect of each metacarpus were digitised and examined to determine the morphology of the calcified cartilage layer.

Three series of uniaxial tension and compression tests were conducted on two conventional and two highly crosslinked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylenes (UHMWPEs) all prepared from the same lot of medical grade GUR 1050. The conventional materials were unirradiated (control) and gamma irradiated in nitrogen with a dose of 30 kGy. The highly crosslinked UHMWPEs were gamma irradiated at room temperature with 100 kGy and then thermally processed by either annealing below the melt transition at 100 degrees C or by remelting above the melt transition at 150 degrees C. The true stress-strain behavior of the four UHMWPE materials was characterized as a function of strain rate (between 0.02 and 0.10 s(-1)) and test temperature (20-60 degrees C). Although annealing and remelting of UHMWPE are primarily considered as methods of improving oxidation resistance, thermal processing was found to significantly impact the crystallinity, and hence the mechanical behavior, of the highly crosslinked UHMWPE. The crystallinity and radiation dose were key predictors of the uniaxial yielding, plastic flow, and failure properties of conventional and highly crosslinked UHMWPEs. The thermomechanical behavior of UHMWPE was accurately predicted using an Arrhenius model, and the associated activation energies for thermal softening were related to the crystallinity of the polymers. The conventional and highly crosslinked UHMWPEs exhibited low strain rate dependence in power law relationships, comparable to metals. In light of the unifying trends observed in the true stress-strain curves of the four materials investigated in this study, both crosslinking (governed by the gamma radiation dose) and crystallinity (governed by the thermal processing) were found to be useful predictors of the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE for a wide range of test temperatures and rates.

The lack of a standardized definition of a B virus-free macaque is compounded by the fact that all assays inherently result in some false antibody-positive or -negative data, and reconciliation is equivocal. Long-term follow-up of a colony in which elimination of B virus is actively being attempted will necessarily result in a relatively small sample within the population being incorrectly categorized with regard to antibody status. The goal of this study was to determine whether serially collected serologic data demonstrated patterns that could be used to predict whether an animal was genuinely in the process of B virus antibody seroconversion. The best indication of seroconversion was an ELISA titer of &gt; 1:500 or a positive result on a confirmatory test. Patterns of seroreactivity are more useful in identifying B virus-positive macaques during the screening phase of SPF colony development than during the maintenance phase.", "answer": "Patterns of seroreactivity are more useful in identifying B virus-positive macaques during the screening phase of SPF colony development because they help in accurately determining the B virus status, crucial for establishing a B virus-free colony.", "covered": false}

Sudden unexpected deaths have been reported with antipsychotic use since the early 1960s. In some cases the antipsychotic may be unrelated to death, but in others it appears to be a causal factor. Antipsychotics can cause sudden death by several mechanisms, but particular interest has centred on torsade de pointes (TdP), a polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia that can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. The QTc interval is a heart rate-corrected value that represents the time between the onset of electrical depolarisation of the ventricles and the end of repolarisation. Prolongation of the QTc interval is a surrogate marker for the ability of a drug to cause TdP. In individual patients an absolute QTc interval of &gt;500 msec or an increase of 60 msec from baseline is regarded as indicating an increased risk of TdP. However, TdP can occur with lower QTc values or changes. Concern about a relationship between QTc prolongation, TdP and sudden death applies to a wide range of drugs and has led to the withdrawal or restricted labelling of several. Among antipsychotics available in the UK, sertindole was voluntarily suspended, droperidol was withdrawn, and restricted labelling introduced for thioridazine and pimozide. The degree of QTc prolongation is dose dependent and varies between antipsychotics reflecting their different capacity to block cardiac ion channels. Significant prolongation is not a class effect. Among currently available agents, thioridazine and ziprasidone are associated with the greatest QTc prolongation. Virtually all drugs known to cause TdP block the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(kr)). Arrhythmias are more likely to occur if drug-induced QTc prolongation coexists with other risk factors, such as individual susceptibility, presence of congenital long QT syndromes, heart failure, bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, overdose of a QTc prolonging drug, female sex, restraint, old age, hepatic or renal impairment, and slow metaboliser status. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions can also increase the risk of arrhythmias. Further research is needed to quantify the risk of sudden death with antipsychotics. The risk should be viewed in the context of the overall risks and benefits of antipsychotic treatment. It seems prudent, where possible, to select antipsychotics that are not associated with marked QTc prolongation. If use of a QTc-prolonging drug is warranted, then measures to reduce the risk should be adopted.", "answer": "QTc interval prolongation.", "covered": false}

Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells have been used to treat established experimental tumors by unleashing a cellular immune response against tumor antigens. Such antigens are artificially loaded onto dendritic cells' antigen-presenting molecules by different techniques including incubation with synthetic antigenic determinants, tumor lysates or nucleic acids encoding for those relevant antigens. Ex vivo gene transfer with viral and non-viral vectors is frequently used to obtain expression of the tumor antigens and thereby to formulate the therapeutic vaccines. Efficacy of the approaches is greatly enhanced if dendritic cells are transfected with a number of genes which encode immunostimulating factors. In some cases, such as with IL-12, IL-7 and CD40L genes, injection inside experimental malignancies of thus transfected dendritic cells induces complete tumor regression in several models. In this case tumor antigens are captured by dendritic cells by still unclear mechanisms and transported to lymphoid organs where productive antigen presentation to T-cells takes place.

The key pharmacological action for the clinical use of bisphosphonates lies in the inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Osteoblasts could be other target cells for bisphosphonates. We studied the effects of bisphosphonates on the proliferation and the differentiation of normal human bone trabecular osteoblastic cells (hOB). We tested 4 different compounds: clodronate, pamidronate and 2 newer compounds: ibandronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate and zoledronate, which is a heterocyclic imidazole compound. Ibandronate and zoledronate stimulated hOB cell proliferation by up to 30% (p&lt;0.05) after 72 h for concentrations ranging from 10(-8) M to 10(-5) M. Clodronate transiently enhanced hOB cell survival after only 24 h (+60%, p&lt;0.001) whereas pamidronate had no effect. Longer time course studies, in presence of fetal calf serum, revealed that cell growth was finally reduced by all 4 bisphosphonates (40% after 7 days). Type I collagen synthesis was transiently increased by all 4 bisphosphonates after only 48 h incubation (+17% to +67%, p&lt;0.05). Clodronate increased ALP activity by up to 1.7-fold after 4 days of culture (p&lt;0.05) whereas ibandronate or zoledronate exhibited lesser stimulatory effects (+17 to +30%), and pamidronate had no significant effect. In conclusion, we found that different bisphosphonates, currently used or tested in various clinical conditions, transiently stimulated the growth of preosteoblastic cells and thereafter increased their differentiation according to sequential events (type I collagen synthesis first, then ALP activity to a lesser extent).

Factors influencing their in vitro properties, both under division and after differentiation conditions, are evaluated, with the aim of identifying properties common to the different culture systems reported. This analysis suggests that different culture procedures result in cells with different properties, or even in different cells being isolated. With respect to in vivo performance, present evidence obtained in rodents indicate that cultured human neural precursors, in general, are endowed with excellent integrative properties. Differentiation of the implanted cells, in particular in the case of adult recipients, seems not to be complete, and functionality still needs to be demonstrated. In relation to gene transfer and therapy, aspects currently underexplored, initial data support the view that human neural stem and progenitor cells may serve a role as a platform cell for the delivery of bioactive substances to the diseased CNS. Although a large deal of basic research remains to be done, available data illustrate the enormous potential that human neural precursors isolated, expanded, and characterized in vitro hold for therapeutic applications.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_292_1", "question": "How does the administration of norepinephrine (NE) affect the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) during test ischemia (TI)", "doc_chunk": "Preconditioning modulates susceptibility to ischemia-induced arrhythmias in the rat heart: the role of alpha-adrenergic stimulation and K(ATP) channels. A new concept of cardioprotection based on the exploitation of endogenous mechanisms is known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). It has been hypothesized that substances released during brief ischemic stress (e.g. catecholamines) stimulate the receptors and trigger multiple cell signaling cascades. Opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels [K(ATP)] has been suggested as a possible final step in the mechanisms of protection. In this study, the role of adrenergic activation was tested in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to test ischemia (TI; 30 min occlusion of LAD coronary artery) by: 1) mimicking IPC (5 min ischemia, 10 min reperfusion) with short-term (5 min) administration of norepinephrine (NE, 1 microM), 15 min prior to TI; 2) blockade with beta- or alpha1-receptor antagonists, propranolol (10 microM) and prazosin (2 microM), respectively, applied 15 min prior to TI during IPC. The role of K(ATP) opening was examined by perfusion with a K(ATP) blocker glibenclamide (10 microM) during IPC. Both IPC and NE-induced PC effectively reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) to 33% and 37%, respectively, vs 100% in the non-PC controls, whereby ventricular fibrillation (VF) was totally abolished by IPC and markedly suppressed by PC with NE (0% and 10%, respectively, vs 70% in the non-PC hearts; P &lt; 0.05). The severity of arrhythmias (arrhythmia score, AS) was also markedly attenuated by both interventions (IPC: AS 1.7 +/- 0.4; NE-PC: AS 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs AS 4.1 +/- 0.2 in the controls; P &lt; 0.05). Protection was not suppressed by propranolol (VT 28%; VF 14%; AS 2.2 +/- 0.6), whereas prazosin reversed the protective effect of PC (VT 83%; VF 67%; AS 4.0 +/- 0.8). Antiarrhythmic protection afforded by NE-PC was abolished by pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin (25 microg/kg, i.p.) given 48 h prior to the experiments. Glibenclamide did not suppress the IPC-induced protection. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the rat heart to ischemic arrhythmias can be modulated by IPC. Protection is mediated via stimulation of alpha1-adrenergic receptors coupled with Gi-proteins but glibenclamide-sensitive K(ATP) channels do not appear to be involved in the mechanisms of antiarrhythmic protection in this model.", "answer": "The administration of norepinephrine (NE) reduces the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) to 37% and markedly suppresses ventricular fibrillation (VF) to 10% during test ischemia.", "covered": false}

To explore a static intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique of a more homogeneous isodose distribution to an irregular-shaped tumour of the ethmoid sinus, with concomitantly sparing the adjacent critical normal organs including the orbit. We conducted a static IMRT technique adding 2 or smaller complementary boost-fields to the underdosed volume in the PTV, which resulted from complete blocking of the orbits in all coplanar or non-coplanar main ports of the standard 3-D CRT. The standard 3-D CRT plans (Plan A) and IMRT plans adding complementary boost fields (Plan B) were established for 10 patients with ethmoid sinus cancer. Two sets of different plans for each patient were compared using isodose distribution, dose statistics, and dose volume histogram (DVH) of the planning target volume (PTV) and also using dose statistics and DVH of the adjacent critical structures. The IMRT plans adding 2 or more complementary boost-fields (Plan B) for each patient demonstrated better coverage and improved dose homogeneity of the PTV compared to the standard 3-D CRT plan (Plan A). Moreover, the radiation doses to adjacent normal tissue organs, such as the orbits, optic nerves, brain stem and optic chiasm were similarly spared in both plans. With concomitantly sparing the surrounding visual pathway structures, our IMRT technique using the complementary boost-fields was quantitatively better than current standard 3-D CRT technique with respect to the dose homogeneity within the PTV.

Helicobacter pylori colonization induces inflammation in essentially all hosts, a persistent process that increases the risk of developing distal gastric adenocarcinoma. However, only a small percentage of persons carrying H. pylori develop neoplasia; enhanced risk may be related to differences in expression of specific bacterial products, differences in the host response to the bacteria, or the interaction between host and microbe. H. pylori strains that have the cag pathogenicity island are associated with further increased risk for developing distal gastric cancer; however, host responses to H. pylori, such as altered epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, also may be important in lowering the threshold for carcinogenesis. H. pylori cag+ strains selectively enhance proliferation and attenuate apoptosis in human mucosa compared to cag- strains. However, cag+ strains also induce more severe gastritis, suggesting that host inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and hormones may modulate H. pylori-induced alterations in cellular turnover. In the Mongolian gerbil model of gastric carcinogenesis, apoptosis increases early and transiently following H. pylori infection, but scores progressively decline despite worsening gastric inflammation. Epithelial cell proliferation peaks later and is significantly related to increased gastrin levels, suggesting that epithelial cell growth in H. pylori-colonized mucosa may be mediated by gastrin-dependent mechanisms. An emerging model invoked by these data is one in which H. pylori cag+ strains, in conjunction with host mediators, enhance gastric epithelial cell proliferation but not apoptosis in vivo. The combination of increased proliferation without a concordant increase in apoptosis may therefore contribute to the heightened retention of mutagenized cells, which over decades may increase the subsequent risk for gastric cancer.", "answer": "Epithelial cell growth in H. pylori-colonized mucosa is mediated by gastrin-dependent mechanisms.", "covered": false}

Excitable systems modelled by reaction-diffusion equation may be expected to produce quite complex spatial patterns. Winfree [1974] demonstrated experimentally, in the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction, the existence of particular waves called rotating spiral waves. Later Keener and Tyson [1986] presented a thorough analysis of these waves in excitable systems. Spiral waves can also be observed in brain tissue (Shibata and Bures [1974]), while it seems that the precursor to cardiac fibrillation is the appearance of rotating waves of electrical impulses (Winfree [1983]). In this work we suppose the appearance of Ca++ spiral waves in the vegetal pole of ascidian egg cells after the first ooplasmic segregation. Previously we observed that (Ballarò and Reas [2000a]), when the myoplasm is completely localized in the vegetal region (excitable stage) and the ascidian egg cell is perturbed by an increase of Ca++ concentration in the culture medium, the cell reacts by showing persistent mechanical waves of contraction which exist as long as the cell is perturbed. Experimentally we observed the production of a polar lobe located in the vegetal region and the change of the inclination of mitotic furrow, after the appearance of a myoplasmic spiral wave in the vegetal pole. So we suppose that the myoplasmic spiral wave is due to a Ca++ spiral wave, and the myoplasmic spiral wave then causes the changes in the shape of the cell (polar lobe, inclination of mitotic furrow, etc.). Moreover we give a simple geometrical description of a spiral wave.", "answer": "The experimental evidence includes observations of persistent mechanical waves of contraction and morphological changes in fertilized ascidian eggs, attributed to myoplasmic and Ca++ spiral waves.", "covered": false}

Continuous hemofiltration and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHF/CHDF) were developed as continuous renal replacement therapy for patients with severe conditons and has come to be widely performed mainly in critical care, taking the place of intermittent hemodialysis. The membrane pore size of a hemofilter used for CHF/CHDF allows passage of substances ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 Da, and the method for solute removal in CHF/CHDF employs the principle of convection, which is advantageous for removing middle- to high-molecular-weight substances. As apheresis therapy to remove pathogenic substances in blood, CHF/CHDF is therefore being investigated for its possible effect on various morbid conditions. It has recently been found that CHF/CHDF removes humoral mediators including cytokines, particularly in severe systemic inflammatory response syndromes such as septic shock and severe acute pancreatitis. CHF/CHDF is thus beginning to be performed for the prevention and treatment of organ dysfunction secondary to septic shock, trauma, or acute pancreatitis. CHF/CHDF is also efficacious as artificial liver support in preventing adverse effects caused by plasma exchange (PE) and for continuous removal of hepatic coma-inducing substances.

Auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) has been developed in order to benefit from the efficacy of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), but to avoid the negative counterpart of OLT which is to eliminate the possibility of native liver (NL) regeneration and which consequently implies a life-long immunosuppression. In our institution we performed 16 consecutive APOLTs in 15 patients between October 1992 and December 1999. Patients' mean age was 30 years (range 0.5-65 years). The causes of FHF were viral (HAV = 3; HBV = 3), drugs (n = 4), or others (n = 5). None of the patients had a history of chronic liver disease. The decision to transplant was taken when the patients met well-defined criteria. All but one of the patients were in a coma. Five patients died, 10 patients are alive (66.7%). Regeneration of the NL occurred in 11 of the 15 patients (73.3%) and in 8 of the 10 survivors. Six of these 8 patients have permanently stopped immunosuppressive therapy. These results can be favorably compared with those of OLT for FHF. In the European Transplant Registry, the survival rate is 57% at 5 years (2612 patients receiving OLT for FHF between 1988 and 1998). In our experience the survival rate is 59% at 5 years (42 patients receiving OLT for FHF between 1987 and 1999). APOLT is feasible in both adults and children; it rapidly restored liver function and reversed encephalopathy. Right APOLT seems more advisable since the right liver provides more functional hepatocytes; however, left APOLT harvested in an adult appears sufficient for a child. APOLT should be proposed only to patients with high chances of liver regeneration: age of recipient, etiology of liver failure, interval between onset of jaundice and occurrence of encephalopathy, and quality of liver graft are early prognostic indicators.

Radiation therapy has long been a mainstay in the treatment of ependymoma. Concerns about the long-term effects of radiation therapy have made many parents and caregivers wary of this treatment modality. However, with the advent of conformal radiation and evidence supporting its use in younger children (ie, &lt; 3 years old), the standard of care for childhood ependymoma is rapidly evolving to include immediate postoperative radiation therapy for all pediatric patients. The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of ependymoma has diminished recently because (1) chemotherapy fails to delay radiation therapy for a meaningful period of time; (2) tumors that progress during chemotherapy do not respond as well to subsequent irradiation; and (3) the combination of chemotherapy and irradiation does not improve overall survival. However, chemotherapy may make residual tumor more amenable to a second resection. Fewer than 50% of pediatric patients with ependymoma undergo complete resection before receiving radiation therapy. Because the extent of resection is one of the most important prognostic factors in the treatment of this disease, increasing the rate of complete resections is a significant means of increasing long-term survival.

Cognitive vitality is essential to quality of life and survival in old age. With normal aging, cognitive changes such as slowed speed of processing are common, but there is substantial interindividual variability, and cognitive decline is clearly not inevitable. In this review, we focus on recent research investigating the association of various lifestyle factors and medical comorbidities with cognitive aging. Most of these factors are potentially modifiable or manageable, and some are protective. For example, animal and human studies suggest that lifelong learning, mental and physical exercise, continuing social engagement, stress reduction, and proper nutrition may be important factors in promoting cognitive vitality in aging. Manageable medical comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, also contribute to cognitive decline in older persons. Other comorbidities such as smoking and excess alcohol intake may contribute to cognitive decline, and avoiding these activities may promote cognitive vitality in aging. Various therapeutics, including cognitive enhancers and protective agents such as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, may eventually prove useful as adjuncts for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline with aging. The data presented in this review should interest physicians who provide preventive care management to middle-aged and older individuals who seek to maintain cognitive vitality with aging.", "answer": "Lifelong learning and mental exercises promote cognitive vitality in aging by engaging and stimulating the brain, thereby helping to maintain and enhance cognitive functions.", "covered": false}

Over the past decade, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have been managed with preoperative chemoradiation. Patients achieving a complete clinical response to preoperative chemoradiation have had better pelvic tumor control, sphincterpreservation, and overall survival than those with gross residual disease. Some patients achieving a complete clinical response have even had rectal-preserving surgery (full-thickness local excision). These results emphasize the importance of maximizing tumor response. Further improvement in response and survival could be achieved by using novel chemotherapeutic agents or through tumor-selective molecular targeting strategies that enhance the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) is a novel chemotherapy agent being evaluated clinically as a radiosensitizing agent in rectal cancer. Inhibition of several molecular targets-such as epidermal growth factor receptor, ras oncogene activation, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, and neoangiogenesis-appears to be tumor-selective in preclinical models. COX-2 expression has been shown to enhance cytotoxic therapy in preclinical models. In vitro and in vivo studies show that selective COX-2 inhibition enhances the effects of radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. COX-2 is also markedly upregulated in human colorectal cancer and appears to be associated with adverse patient prognosis. Thus, integration of molecular targeting, such as COX-2 selective inhibition with existing chemoradiation approaches, may provide selective tumor radiosensitization and chemosensitization, resulting in improved pelvic control, sphincter preservation, and overall survival.", "answer": "Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer at The University of Texas M.

The arm from which the flap will be harvested is left untucked and placed on an arm board. It is the author’s preference to harvest the flap on a pivoting arm board, as opposed to a hand surgery table, when the free flap is being harvested for head and neck reconstruction. The arm board has a smaller, slimmer profile, which reduces the displacement of the ablative surgeon or assistant from the head and neck if they are operating on the same side as the flap harvest; it will also move along with the operating table, thereby obviating the need to reposition it independently if the abltaive surgeon requires repositioning of the operating table.

Unlike the many chemotherapeutic agents that do not effectively stop blood flow or induce necrosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, AC-7700 has been shown to inhibit tubulin polymerization and selectively stop tumor blood flow. The aim of this study was to elucidate the antivascular and antitumor effects of AC-7700 on rat hepatoma. AH-130 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, were solidified and implanted into the liver of Donryu rats. Vascularity of the liver tumor was directly identified by in-vivo fluorescence microscopy from 0 to 60 min after the injection of 10 mg/kg AC-7700. To observe the antivascular effect of AC-7700, the vascular density of the tumor was measured and assessed as the ratio of preinjection to postinjection values. The antitumor effects were evaluated with histopathologic findings and analysis of animal survival. In-vivo microscopic observation showed that tumor perfusion diminished within 30 min after AC-7700 administration. Vascular density in the AC-7700 group was significantly less than that in the control group at 60 min (AC-7700, 26.3 +/- 16.4%; control, 88.5 +/- 9.2%; P &lt; 0.001).

We suppose that the main influencing climatic factor, which could excite multiform biological reactions, is atmospheric electricity, E, whose parameters depend strongly on the content of the air column and on the meteorological conditions in this volume, especially along its ground path. A clear connection between wind speed Vw and coarse aerosol concentration N(T) with electric field intensity E exists only for limited intervals of Vw, and N(T). In these ranges, the mean correlation coefficients p(E; Vw) and p(E; N(T)) are usually up to 0.45. In quiet weather, rho is significantly larger than in the equinox seasons or in transferred weather situations.

Ninety-three patient charts were analyzed. Forty-six percent of the patients were victims of a motor vehicle crash. Patients were mostly transferred to the level I trauma center for non-spine orthopedic injuries (28%), followed by spine injuries (14%) and head injuries (13%). These patients were stable, as manifested by an average trauma score of 11.6. However, there was a significant positive interaction between injury severity score and time to definitive care. The authors infer from the data analysis that more serious or complex injuries took longer to evaluate. Since these patients were physiologically stable, reducing the number of twice-transferred trauma patients will involve refining transfer protocols concerning the need for specialty care.", "answer": "Non-spine orthopedic injuries.", "covered": false}

The primary site of the infection is the nail bed, where the acute infection occurs with a low-grade inflammatory response and progresses to a chronic phase of the nail bed infection as total dystrophic onychomycosis. Histologically, the acute lesion of onychomycosis manifests as spongiosis, acanthosis, papillomatosis with edema, and hyperkeratosis. These signs resemble psoriasis pathology. [14] As in most infections, a dense inflammatory infiltrate develops. Onychomycosis also eventually infects the viable nail matrixOnychomycosis Nail Changes. Onychomycosis secondarily damages the nail matrix as the nail bed becomes hyperkeratotic and thickened to shed the fungal infection. The dermatophyte also invades the overlying nail plate, detaching and distorting it over time ( Figure 2 . White Superficial Onychomycosis). The nail plate becomes elevated and misaligned as the infection enters the chronic total dystrophic clinical stage of onychomycosis (TDO) ( Figure 3. Onychomycosis Nail Changes). [15] At this chronic stage of the infection, there are large amounts of compact hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis with sparse perivascular infiltrate. Dermatophytosis and subungual seromas can occur.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_1089_1", "question": "Why is withdrawal of corticosteroids considered beneficial in liver transplant patients?", "doc_chunk": "Single-agent immunosuppression after liver transplantation: what is possible? Orthotopic liver transplantation is a life saving and life enhancing procedure. The development of immunosuppressive drugs has contributed to the high rate of success in terms of both patient and graft survival. However, the considerable adverse effects of these therapies are affecting long-term outcomes of transplant recipients. Complications related to immunosuppression are responsible for the majority of deaths in patients surviving more than 1 year. Therefore, the search for an optimal immunosuppressive regimen has become of paramount importance. The liver has proved to be an 'immunologically privileged' organ, capable in several animal models to be accepted as an allograft without any intervention on the immune system of the recipient. In some human liver allografts acceptance of the new organ is recognised after withdrawal of immunosuppressants, but prior identification of such individuals is not yet possible, thus negating this management option. Graft-recipient interaction is peculiar in liver transplantation: acute cellular rejection does not always need to be treated, and if it is not severe, appears to be associated with a better survival of both patient and graft. In the last decade there has been an evolution of immunosuppressive protocols, driven by empirical observation and a deeper understanding of immunological events after transplant. However, most modifications have been made because of the necessity to reduce long-term drug related morbidity and mortality. Withdrawal of corticosteroids has proven to be safely achievable in most patients, with no deleterious effects on patient or graft survival but with a great benefit in terms of reduction of incidence of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Long-term 'steroid-free' regimens are therefore now widely used. Patients with stable graft function can be easily maintained using a single drug usually after 6 or 12 months and usually with a calcineurin inhibitor. The more evolved step of using monotherapy ab initio has also proven to be effective in a few studies and needs to be explored further. In the future new strategies will be designed to help the development of tolerance of the allograft, selectively stimulating instead of suppressing the immune reaction of the recipient.", "answer": "Beneficial for reducing metabolic and cardiovascular complications without harming patient or graft survival.", "covered": false}

A training set of 27 propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) analogues was used to construct four-dimensional (4D) quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for three screens of biological activity: loss of righting reflex (LORR) in tadpoles, enhancement of agonist activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor, and direct (agonist-independent) activation of the receptor. The three resulting 4D-QSAR models are almost identical in form, and all suggest three key ligand-receptor interaction sites. The formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bond involving the proton of the ligand -OH group is the most important binding interaction. A hydrophobic pocket binding interaction involving the six-substituent is the second most significant binding site, and a similar hydrophobic pocket binding interaction near the two-substituent is the third postulated binding site from the 4D-QSAR models.

Zooplankton organisms sampled downstream of LA-40 contain higher [MeHg] (183+/-50 ng g(-1) dry wt.) than those of neighbouring natural lakes (66+/-37 ng g(-1) dry wt.). OM in sediment and zooplankton samples has been characterised applying atomic carbon/nitrogen ratios (C/N) and stable carbon isotopic ratios (delta13C). While C/ N ratios in zooplankton from Lake 154 (5.6+/-0.4) do not differ from samples of natural lakes (5.7+/-0.1), delta13C signatures are more depleted at stations close to the discharge of LA-40 (-33+/-0.4/1000) with respect to zooplankton from unperturbed lakes (-30.6+/-0.7/1000). Results of this tracer study suggest that the biochemical composition of OM in flooded sediments did not modify the biochemical composition of zooplankton and can therefore not predict [MeHg] in zooplankton.", "answer": "The biochemical composition of organic matter in sediments does not predict mercury concentrations in zooplankton.", "covered": false}

The authors investigated whether emergency medical technicians could decrease ED use by patients with nonurgent concerns who use 911 by appropriately identifying and triaging them to alternate care destinations. From August 2000 through January 2001, two King County fire-based emergency medical services (EMS) agencies participated in an alternate care destination program for patients with specific low-acuity diagnosis codes (intervention group). Eligible patients were offered care at a clinic-based destination as an alternate to the ED (n = 1,016). The frequency of the destination of care (ED, clinic, or home) for the intervention group was compared with a matched control group that was comprised of a preintervention historical cohort of EMS encounters from the same two fire-based agencies and with the same acuity and diagnosis criteria and seasonal interval (n = 2,617). Compared with the preintervention group, a smaller proportion of patients in the intervention group received care in the ED (44.6% vs. 51.8%, p = 0.001), while a greater proportion of patients in the intervention group received clinic care (8.0% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.001) or home care (no transport) (47.4 vs. 43.7%, p = 0.043).

This paper documents results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial investigating the effect of standardised Echinacea extract on 8 horses. Animals were supplemented with Echinacea or placebo for 42 days, and their response to supplements recorded. Treatment with Echinacea increased phagocytic ability of isolated neutrophils, boosted peripheral lymphocyte counts and appeared to stimulate neutrophil migration from peripheral circulation into the tissues. Echinacea supplement also increased the size and concentration of peripheral red blood cells, and the concentration of haemoglobin and packed cell volume. It was concluded that Echinacea effectively stimulates equine immunocompetence, and the plant extract behaves, in equine subjects, as a haematinic agent, i.e. one which improves the quality of blood by increasing haemoglobin levels and the number of erythrocytes and which, by virtue of their effects on oxygen transport cells, are considered to improve parameters of exercise physiology and performance.", "answer": "Echinacea supplementation in horses increased the phagocytic ability of neutrophils, boosted lymphocyte counts, and stimulated neutrophil migration into tissues.", "covered": false}

The introduction of species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approaches to ecological risk assessment offers the potential for a more transparent scientific basis for the derivation of predicted no-effect concentrations. However, conventional SSD methodologies have relied on standard distributions (e.g., log logistic, log normal) that are not necessarily based on sound ecological or statistical grounds. More recently, bootstrap resampling techniques that do not rely on distributional assumptions have been applied to the problem. Here we describe how a more advanced bootstrap methodology may be applied to derive better point estimates and confidence intervals for SSD estimates of safe environmental concentrations. Motivated by the fact that the true SSD may not fit any standard model category, we go on to consider a hybrid bootstrap regression approach. This can yield a substantially different estimate for the SSD when compared with both the basic bootstrap and the more frequently used parametric curve approaches. With increasing use of SSDs in ecological risk assessment, it is now imperative that the scientific community develops agreement over appropriate methods for their derivation.", "answer": "Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) are used in ecological risk assessment to estimate safe environmental concentrations based on the sensitivity of various species to a particular stressor, with recent improvements including bootstrap resampling techniques for better accuracy.", "covered": false}

By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred. The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor. A 35-year-old man was shot during an armed robbery. The bullet entry wound was in the right fourth intercostal space, above the nipple. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to the emergency room demonstrated complete collapse of the lung.

We aimed to evaluate the pathological features of hypovascular or avascular renal cell carcinoma (RCC), by the retrospective review of the histological features that coincide with hypovascular or avascular RCC. Seven hundred and ninety-one patients who underwent both preoperative angiography and nephrectomy were examined. Of these patients, the 126 patients (15.9%) who showed hypovascular or avascular angiographic features were selected. Patients with hemorrhage or cyst(s), or with at least 50% necrosis or more in the tumor, and those with renal tumor metastatic to the kidney were excluded. The criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (1998) were adopted for the histological classification. Papillary RCC was the most frequently observed hypovascular or avascular renal tumor (44 cases; 34.9%). The vascularity differed among the variants, i.e., some cases had a basophilic and solid variant with avascular features, while the remaining cases had wide stromal organization showing hypovascular features.

The expression of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) was studied in rat primary Sertoli cells by Northern blot analysis. Gp130 mRNA of 9.0 and 7.5 kb were detected in a variety of rat tissues including the testis. Gp130 mRNAs were detected in isolated, immature Sertoli cells. The levels of gp130 were significantly stimulated by the addition of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not by the addition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). IL-6 activates intracellular signaling by binding with a receptor consisting of an 80-kDa ligand-binding protein, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and a second 130-kDa protein, gp130. As previously reported, expression of IL-6R mRNA in rat Sertoli cells was stimulated not only by IL-1-beta and IL-6 but also by FSH. In contrast, gp130 mRNA expression was not stimulated by FSH in our analysis.

However, the correlation between QT variables and sudden cardiac death in these patients remains uncertain. We evaluated the correlation between QT variables and sudden cardiac death and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmia (SCD/VT) in patients with HCM associated with the cTnI mutation. We analyzed 10 probands with HCM associated with the cTnI gene K183del and their family members. The subjects were divided into three groups: Group A (n = 7), mutation carriers with SCD/VT; Group B (n = 16), mutation carriers without SCD/VT; Group C (n = 24), no mutation carriers. QT intervals were corrected using Bazett's formula. Maximum QTc and corrected QT dispersion were significantly longer in Groups A and B than in Group C. However, there were no differences in either parameter between Groups A and B. On the contrary, the peak-to-end interval of T wave/QT interval in V5 (Tpe) in Group A was significantly longer than that in Groups B and C. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Tpe was a good clinical predictor for SCD/VT in patients with HCM in this study.

The material was predegraded just to the point of viscous disintegration to test the PDLLA in the moment of its most aggressive effect on the surrounding tissue. Racemic amorphous PDLLA was injection-molded with or without the admixture of 1 mol NaP per 100 mol lactate, the degradation product of PDLLA (=1 mol%) to form 20mm x 3 mm x 2mm rods. Predegradation was performed by storing the rods at 55 degrees C for 14 days, just to the point of beginning dissolution. Predegraded PDLLA or PDLLA + NaP samples were used for in vitro incubation tests, as well as for the in vivo study, where the rods were implanted into the spinal muscles of 30 male Wistar rats. Repeatedly, measurements of the pH-value were made in the incubation solutions in vitro. The surrounding tissue of the implanted samples as well as the normal contralateral muscle tissue was checked for its pH-value in a group of 3 rats, respectively, anaesthesized at various time intervals after implantation. After these measurements the implants and their surrounding tissues were excised for histological examination. In Ringer's solution pH-values dropped immediately within the first week of incubation of both predegraded materials reaching -4 pH units after 4 weeks in the PDLLA containing medium, after 6 weeks in the PDLLA + NaP containing medium. Soerensen buffer slowed the pH decrease with significant differences between the material groups up to the 28th week.

The care of pregnant patients is best undertaken with an interprofessional team approach. Healthcare providers of women during pregnancy have the responsibility to screen and monitor the fetus to identify potential problems. This allows the practitioner to provide patient-centered, targeted treatment, and follow-up. Patients should be educated about the importance of self-monitoring of fetal movements. When decreased fetal movement is perceived, the team should work together to evaluate the fetus further. Many techniques for monitoring fetal movement are controversial and lack sufficient study to document their efficacy. In theory, detecting risk factors and complications during pregnancy could lower neonatal morbidity and mortality. [10] More study is needed to evaluate current methods and their effectiveness in both detection and long-term effects. Monitoring and then subsequent response with interventions have the potential to improve patient outcomes.", "answer": "Self-monitoring of fetal movements is important because it helps in early detection of potential fetal complications, allowing for timely intervention.", "covered": true}

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has had a dramatic impact on the morbidity and mortality of individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In addition to contributing to dramatic declines in the incidence of several opportunistic infections, HAART is affecting the incidences of several acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies. The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has dropped precipitously since the introduction of HAART in 1995. Systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) appears to be declining in incidence as well, but to a lesser degree than KS and PCNSL. On the contrary, the incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma has not significantly changed in the HAART era. The impact of HAART on the epidemiology of other HIV-associated malignancies, including Hodgkin's disease and anal carcinoma, remains unclear. Data regarding the impact of HAART on the natural history and treatment outcomes of HIV-associated malignancies are limited. The possibility of direct and indirect roles of HIV in HIV-related carcinogenesis suggests that antiretroviral therapy may be an important component of the treatment strategy for several HIV-related malignancies. Patients with HIV-NHL treated with HAART in addition to chemotherapy experience fewer intercurrent opportunistic infections. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of HAART and chemotherapy does not appear to significantly increase toxicity.

The IARC/WHO in 1994 concluded that H. pylori is a definite carcinogen in humans based on seroepidemiological evidence. H. pylori infection is associated with both intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer. Strong evidence has accumulated that H. pylori infection has been active in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma in the Mongolian gerbil (MG) model after long term infection and with or without treatment using low-dose chemical carcinogens. There are several criticisms of these reports.

Poorly controlled longstanding diabetes frequently results in sustained hypertension (HTN) which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, hyperglycemia, per se, causes a reversible rise in blood pressure (BP) and increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS activity may raise BP by promoting inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) and/or nonenzymatic generation of vasoconstrictive prostaglandins from peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Therefore, we hypothesized that antioxidant therapy may enhance the BP-lowering effect of glycemia control with insulin replacement in diabetes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by streptozotocin administration and randomized to untreated, antioxidant-treated (vitamin E-fortified food, tocopherol 5000 U/kg chow and vitamin C-fortified H2O, 1000 mg/L), insulin-treated and insulin plus antioxidant-treated groups. Normal rats fed a regular diet or antioxidant-fortified diet served as controls and monitored for 4 weeks. The diabetic animals showed marked hyperglycemia, HTN, proteinuria, depressed tissue glutathione level and elevated plasma lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA) denoting increased ROS activity. Insulin therapy alone resulted in significant, but incomplete reduction in BP and plasma MDA but not proteinuria. Antioxidant therapy alone had no effect on the measured parameters in either the diabetic or control animals. However, combined insulin and antioxidant therapies normalized BP, plasma MDA and urinary protein in the diabetic animals. As expected, uncontrolled diabetes resulted in glomerular hyperfiltration which was partially reversed by insulin therapy, but was unaffected by antioxidant therapy. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia in the early phase of diabetes was associated with elevated plasma MDA, HTN and proteinuria.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is responsible for more than a half of the cases of chronic viral hepatitis in Japan. About 20% of patients who are chronically infected with the virus develop cirrhosis about 20-30 years after the infection, with hepatocellular carcinoma developing in about 5% of patients a year. The only drug that effectively reduces the virus is interferon, but complete eradication of the virus can be obtained in only 30%-40% of treated patients. Reevaluation of the predictive factors to eradicate the virus by 24-week interferon therapy showed that the genotype other than 1b, a low virus load, and multiple amino acid substitutions in the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) of genotype 1b are statistically significant predictive factors. Amino acid substitution in the PePHD domain of the E2 protein was rare and was unrelated with the outcome of interferon therapy. The fluctuation of the virus titer measured by branched DNA during a 2-year observation period was less that 10-fold in most patients, and amino acid substitutions in the ISDR were rare in such patients, suggesting that one point measurement of these parameters may be useful to select candidates for interferon therapy. A comparison of patients treated with interferon and untreated patients from the viewpoint of cancer prevention showed only a slight decrease in the risk of treated patients developing hepatocellular carcinoma. However, patients who showed normal alanine amino-transaminase (ALT) irrespective of virus clearance showed a significantly reduced risk of liver carcinogenesis.

Sudden unexpected deaths have been reported with antipsychotic use since the early 1960s. In some cases the antipsychotic may be unrelated to death, but in others it appears to be a causal factor. Antipsychotics can cause sudden death by several mechanisms, but particular interest has centred on torsade de pointes (TdP), a polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia that can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. The QTc interval is a heart rate-corrected value that represents the time between the onset of electrical depolarisation of the ventricles and the end of repolarisation. Prolongation of the QTc interval is a surrogate marker for the ability of a drug to cause TdP. In individual patients an absolute QTc interval of &gt;500 msec or an increase of 60 msec from baseline is regarded as indicating an increased risk of TdP. However, TdP can occur with lower QTc values or changes. Concern about a relationship between QTc prolongation, TdP and sudden death applies to a wide range of drugs and has led to the withdrawal or restricted labelling of several. Among antipsychotics available in the UK, sertindole was voluntarily suspended, droperidol was withdrawn, and restricted labelling introduced for thioridazine and pimozide. The degree of QTc prolongation is dose dependent and varies between antipsychotics reflecting their different capacity to block cardiac ion channels. Significant prolongation is not a class effect. Among currently available agents, thioridazine and ziprasidone are associated with the greatest QTc prolongation. Virtually all drugs known to cause TdP block the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(kr)). Arrhythmias are more likely to occur if drug-induced QTc prolongation coexists with other risk factors, such as individual susceptibility, presence of congenital long QT syndromes, heart failure, bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, overdose of a QTc prolonging drug, female sex, restraint, old age, hepatic or renal impairment, and slow metaboliser status. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions can also increase the risk of arrhythmias. Further research is needed to quantify the risk of sudden death with antipsychotics. The risk should be viewed in the context of the overall risks and benefits of antipsychotic treatment. It seems prudent, where possible, to select antipsychotics that are not associated with marked QTc prolongation. If use of a QTc-prolonging drug is warranted, then measures to reduce the risk should be adopted.", "answer": "Sertindole, droperidol, thioridazine, pimozide.", "covered": false}

Experimental results showed that ferric chloride had lower fluorescence quenching than polyferric sulfate (PFS), indicating more rapid hydrolysis of the monomeric ferric ion in the coagulation and dilution process. The less fluorescence quenching was caused by the lower residual concentration of Fe-humic acid complexes in the filtrate. There was no clear difference in adsorption ability and fluorescence quenching, which indicated that the physical and chemical properties of Fe(OH)3 flocs formed from PFS and FeCl3 coagulation were similar.

Continuous hemofiltration and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHF/CHDF) were developed as continuous renal replacement therapy for patients with severe conditons and has come to be widely performed mainly in critical care, taking the place of intermittent hemodialysis. The membrane pore size of a hemofilter used for CHF/CHDF allows passage of substances ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 Da, and the method for solute removal in CHF/CHDF employs the principle of convection, which is advantageous for removing middle- to high-molecular-weight substances. As apheresis therapy to remove pathogenic substances in blood, CHF/CHDF is therefore being investigated for its possible effect on various morbid conditions. It has recently been found that CHF/CHDF removes humoral mediators including cytokines, particularly in severe systemic inflammatory response syndromes such as septic shock and severe acute pancreatitis. CHF/CHDF is thus beginning to be performed for the prevention and treatment of organ dysfunction secondary to septic shock, trauma, or acute pancreatitis. CHF/CHDF is also efficacious as artificial liver support in preventing adverse effects caused by plasma exchange (PE) and for continuous removal of hepatic coma-inducing substances. CHF/CHDF is effective for various morbid conditions not only as renal replacement therapy, but also as apheresis therapy and is expected to be applied more widely in critical care in the future.", "answer": "Convection.", "covered": false}

The goal of this study was to identify the relative toxicity of ambient areas in the Chesapeake Bay watershed by using a suite of concurrent water column and sediment toxicity tests at seventy-five ambient stations in 20 Chesapeake Bay rivers from 1990 through 1999. Spatial and temporal variability was examined at selected locations throughout the 10 yr study. Inorganic and organic contaminants were evaluated in ambient water and sediment concurrently with water column and sediment tests to assess possible causes of toxicity although absolute causality can not be established. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to develop a multiple endpoint toxicity index (TOX-INDEX) at each station for both water column and sediment toxicity data. Water column tests from the 10 yr testing period showed that 49% of the time, some degree of toxicity was reported. The most toxic sites based on water column results were located in urbanized areas such as the Anacostia River, Elizabeth River and the Middle River. Water quality criteria for copper, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc were exceeded at one or more of these sites.

Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus capable of causing severe respiratory illness in immunocompromised individuals, resides in macrophages during mammalian infection. Previous studies suggest that siderophore-mediated iron transport may be important for the acquisition of iron from transferrin while the organism resides in macrophages. However, iron is also present as hemin in the intracellular environment of the macrophage and may serve as a major source of iron during infection. Thus the ability of H. capsulatum to use hemin and heme-containing compounds was examined. Histoplasma capsulatum G217B was iron-starved by adding the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate to the culture. The addition of 10 microM hemin in the presence of deferoxamine mesylate restored growth to the levels seen in the absence of the chelator. Histoplasma capsulatum was also cultivated in an iron-limited, chemically defined medium without the addition of chelators and it was determined that the organism could also use hemoglobin as a sole source of iron. The method of iron internalization from heme was examined by measuring hemin binding to the yeast-cell surface. The ability of H. capsulatum to bind hemin was related to the nutritional status of the cells. Cells grown under iron-limited conditions bound more heme to the cell surface than did cells grown in medium without chelator. Pretreatment of iron-starved cells with proteinase K eliminated the ability of the organism to bind hemin. Additionally, the pre-incubation of iron-starved H. capsulatum with hemin eliminated the ability of these cells to remove hemin from the solution, although pre-incubation of cells with the iron-free form of hemin, protoporphyrin IX, only modestly affected the ability of the organism to bind hemin. These results suggest that H. capsulatum uses hemin as a sole source of iron and that one mechanism of iron acquisition involves a cell-surface receptor for hemin.", "answer": "Iron-starvation increases the ability of H. capsulatum to bind hemin.", "covered": false}

This resistance to drug-induced apoptosis is likely to play an important role in tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy. The identification of points in the apoptotic pathway at which dysregulation occurs opens up new therapeutic opportunities in situations where conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy approaches fail.

Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells have been used to treat established experimental tumors by unleashing a cellular immune response against tumor antigens. Such antigens are artificially loaded onto dendritic cells' antigen-presenting molecules by different techniques including incubation with synthetic antigenic determinants, tumor lysates or nucleic acids encoding for those relevant antigens. Ex vivo gene transfer with viral and non-viral vectors is frequently used to obtain expression of the tumor antigens and thereby to formulate the therapeutic vaccines. Efficacy of the approaches is greatly enhanced if dendritic cells are transfected with a number of genes which encode immunostimulating factors. In some cases, such as with IL-12, IL-7 and CD40L genes, injection inside experimental malignancies of thus transfected dendritic cells induces complete tumor regression in several models. In this case tumor antigens are captured by dendritic cells by still unclear mechanisms and transported to lymphoid organs where productive antigen presentation to T-cells takes place.

In accidental wounds, trauma and infection can result in dehiscence of primarily closed wounds and in sequestrum formation when cortical bone is exposed. In experimental studies, it has been shown that second intention healing is faster and occurs with less complications in ponies than in horses. Also, a greater initial inflammatory response was seen in ponies. Based on these experimental data, it was hypothesised that accidental wounds in ponies would heal with a lower incidence of wound dehiscence and/or sequestrum formation compared to horses. A retrospective study of 89 ponies and 422 horses with traumatic wounds was performed. The animals, wounds and treatments were categorised and related to the success rate of primary closure and to the incidence of sequestrum formation. The ponies and horses were of similar age and sex. The wounds that were treated were comparable for localisation, duration, degree of contamination and depth in both groups of animals, but there were significantly more cases with ruptured extensor tendons in ponies. Antibiotics and NSAIDs were administered significantly less often to ponies. The success rate of primary closure was significantly higher in ponies than in horses, and sequestra were formed significantly less often in ponies. It was concluded that the results of healing were better in ponies although the external conditions were less favourable. This may be associated with the differences in the initial inflammatory response after injury as found in earlier experimental work, which may result in a better local defence against wound infection.", "answer": "Higher in ponies than in horses.", "covered": false}

This project, therefore, aimed to compare the mechanical properties of intra-articular MPA and diluent-treated middle carpal subchondral and cancellous bone in horses undergoing a short-term treadmill exercise programme. It was hypothesised that subchondral and cancellous bone mechanical properties are influenced by intra-articular administration of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA). Eight 2-year-old female horses had MPA or diluent administered into contralateral middle carpal joints at 14 day intervals, for a total of 4 treatments per horse. Horses underwent a standard treadmill exercise protocol until euthanasia (Day 70). Standard sites were located on the dorsal aspect of third, radial and intermediate carpal bones. Osteochondral samples from each test site were divided into subchondral bone and cancellous bone portions. These were dried, resin-embedded and gold-coated. Microhardness measurements were obtained at each test site. No significant effect of intra-articular treatment was detected. At each site, cancellous bone trabecular struts had an 18-19% higher microhardness value than the overlying subchondral bone. These findings indicate that intra-articular administration of MPA at this dose has no effect on subchondral or cancellous bone adaptation to short-term exercise and, therefore, on the propensity of carpal bones to injury.

Our experiments were conducted using a computer model of the myelinated axon constructed in a software environment GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System). We varied the axonal diameter, myelin sheath thickness, axonal length, stimulation current and channel distribution to determine how these parameters influence the role of noise in spike propagation and hence in preserving the interspike intervals. Our results, expressed as the standard deviation of spike travel times, showed that by stimulating the axons with regular rectangular pulses the interspike intervals were preserved with a microsecond accuracy. Stimulation with pulses imitating postsynaptic currents, greater changes of interspike intervals were found, but the influence of implemented noise on the jitter of interspike intervals was approximately the same.", "answer": "GENESIS.", "covered": false}

The Fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein is a master regulator of iron metabolism in gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, the effect of a partial deletion of the fur gene on the acid-tolerance response and in vivo virulence of avian Escherichia coli was examined. The fur mutant was unable to trigger the acid-tolerance response as observed in the wild-type parent strain. However, the mutant was as virulent as the wild-type parent strain when tested in 1-day-old chickens by subcutaneous inoculation. These data indicate that the fur gene is involved in the acid-tolerance response but not involved in the virulence of E. coli, as detected by the ability to cause septicemia in our experimental infection.", "answer": "The role of the Fur protein in gram-negative bacteria is to regulate iron metabolism and contribute to the acid-tolerance response.", "covered": false}

This study is an update on the lung cancer risk of mild-steel welders with no asbestos exposure using a cohort of nonwelders for comparison. The subjects came from three United States (US) plants that manufactured heavy equipment. The follow-up was extended from 1988 to 1998. The welders were not exposed to asbestos (typical of shipyard welders) or to chromium or nickel (present in stainless steel). There were 108 lung cancer deaths among the welders and 128 such deaths among the nonwelders (double the previous number of lung cancer deaths). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung cancer was 1.46 [95% confidence interval (95% CI 1.20-1.76] for the welders and 1.18 (95% CI 0.98-1.40) for the nonwelders, both in comparison with the US general population. Direct comparison between the welders and nonwelders yielded a rate ratio of 1.22 (95% CI 0.93-1.59). Analyses using a 15-year lag time did not differ greatly from those of an unlagged analysis. There were no marked trends for lung cancer risk by duration of exposure or latency. Evidence from cross-sectional data from a sample of the cohort indicated that the welders smoked somewhat more than the US population and more than the nonwelders. An approximate adjustment of the rate ratios for possible confounding by smoking suggested that smoking may have accounted for about half of the excess lung cancer observed among the welders versus that of either reference population.

A series of N(6)-alkyl-2-alkynyl derivatives of adenosine (Ado) have been synthesized and evaluated for their affinity at human A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors and for their potency at A(2B) adenosine receptor subtypes. The corresponding 2-(1-alkynyl) derivatives of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and Ado are used as reference compounds. Binding studies demonstrated that the activities of 2-alkynylAdos were slightly increased for the adenosine A(1) receptor and slightly decreased for both A(3) and A(2B) subtypes compared to those of their corresponding NECA derivatives, whereas the A(2A) receptor affinities of the two series of nucleosides were similar. The presence of a methyl group on N(6) of the 2-alkynyladenosines, inducing an increase in affinity at the human A(3) receptor and a decrease at the other subtypes, resulted in an increase in A(3) selectivity. In particular, 2-phenylethynyl-N(6)-methylAdo (8b) showed an A(3) affinity in the low nanomolar range (K(i)(A(3)) = 3.4 nM), with a A(1)/A(3) and A(2A)/A(3) selectivity of about 500 and 2500, respectively. These findings motivated us to search for the preparation of new selective radioligands for the A(3) subtype; hence, a procedure to introduce a tritiated alkylamino group in these molecules was carried out. As far as the potency at the A(2B) receptor, the type of 2-alkynyl chain and the presence of the ethylcarboxamido group on the sugar seem to be very important; in fact, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynylNECA [(S)-PHPNECA, 1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM] proved to be one of the most potent A(2B) agonist reported so far. On the other hand, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-N(6)-ethylAdo (9e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.73 microM) showed a significantly increase of potency at the A(2B) subtype in comparison with the N(6)-methyl, N(6)-isopropyl, and the unsubstituted adenosine derivatives, although it resulted in being less potent than (S)-PHPNECA (1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM). These observations suggest that the introduction of an ethyl group in the N(6)-position and an ethylcarboxamido substituent in the 4'-position of (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyladenosine could lead to a compound endowed with high potency at the A(2B) receptor.", "answer": "500", "covered": false}

When maize entered the vigorous vegetation growth stage (e.g. early stem-elongation stage), rare earth-containing fertilizer was applied to the soil with irrigation water. At 10 days after application of the rare earths, significantly dose-dependent accumulative effects of individual rare earth concentrations in the roots and the plant tops of maize were observed, with the exception of Sc and Lu. At the level of 2 kg rare earths ha(-1), accumulative concentrations of most light rare earths (e.g. La, Ce, Pr and Nd) and Gd in the plant tops were much larger than those in the control.

Thickness increase in the abdominal muscles during low abdominal hollowing has been measured with real-time ultrasound scanning and may indicate muscle contraction. The present study investigated the effect of instructing PF contraction on TrA thickness increase during low abdominal hollowing. Twelve females and eight males with no reported pelvic floor dysfunction or low back pain in the last two years were taught low abdominal hollowing in four-point kneeling. Subjects performed low abdominal hollowing with and without instruction to contract PF in random order. Transversus abdominis, obliquus internus (OI) and obliquus externus (OE) thickness were measured with ultrasound scanning at rest and during both tests. Mean increase in TrA thickness during low abdominal hollowing was 49.71% (SD 26.76%), during low abdominal hollowing with PF it was 65.81% (SD 23.53%). Paired Student's t-tests indicated a significant difference between tests (p = 0.015). There were no significant differences between tests for OE or OI thickness increase. Instructing healthy subjects to co-contract PF results in greater increase in TrA thickness during low abdominal hollowing in four-point kneeling. This may indicate greater contraction of TrA and thus be useful for clinicians training TrA.

Abundant evidence indicates that 11betaHSD2 is expressed as mRNA and protein in both adrenal cortex and adrenal tumors. In contrast, 11betaHSD1 has been investigated to a much lesser degree. We therefore studied and compared the expression and activity of the two isoenzymes in the human adrenal cortex (HAC) and cortisol-secreting adenomas (CSAs). Six HAC and six CSA specimens were studied. 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 gene expression was studied by conventional and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity was assayed by measuring the capacity of both microsomal fraction and tissue fragments to convert [3H]cortisone to [3H]cortisol and vice versa. Steroid hormones were separated and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and cortisol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic assay demonstrated higher 11betaHSD1 expression and activity and lower 11betaHSD2 expression and activity in CSAs than in HACs. CSA slices secreted larger amounts of cortisol than did HAC specimens, and the cholesterol side-chain-cleaving enzyme inhibitor aminoglutethimide, by blocking the early step of steroid synthesis, reduced cortisol secretion by approximately 70%. Aminoglutethimide decreased [3H]cortisol production from [3H]cortisone and increased [3H]cortisone production from [3H]cortisol in both tissues, thereby annulling differences in 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity between HACs and CSAs. Collectively, our findings indicate that 1) both 11betaHSD isoenzymes are expressed as mRNA and proteins in the HAC and CSA, with 11betaHSD1 upregulated and 1betaHSD2 downregulated in CSAs; and 2) 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 activity is positively and negatively correlated with the intracellular concentration of steroid hormones. Hence, 11betaHSD isoenzymes could act as amplifiers of the secretagogue effect of agonists and could contribute to the elevated hormonal secretion of CSAs.", "answer": "Aminoglutethimide decreases cortisol production from cortisone and increases cortisone production from cortisol, equalizing the activity of 11betaHSD1 and 11betaHSD2 between cortisol-secreting adenomas and the human adrenal cortex.", "covered": false}

Lentiviral vectors based on HIV-1, HIV-2, or SIV have the ability to transduce dividing and non-dividing T cells, dendritic cells, hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages, which are the main target cells for gene therapy of HIV-1 infection. Besides their function as gene delivery vehicles, lentiviral vector backbones containing the cis-acting sequences necessary to perform a complete replication cycle in the presence of viral proteins provided in trans, have the ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication by several mechanisms that include sequestration of the regulatory proteins Tat and Rev, competition for packaging into virions and possibly by inhibition of reverse transcription in heterodimeric virions. Expression of anti-HIV-1 genes in these vectors would strengthen the potency of this inhibition.

In this work, etanidazole (one type of hypoxic radiosensitizer) is encapsulated into spray dried poly(D),L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres and then compressed into discs for controlled release applications. Etanidazole is characterized by intracellular glutathione depletion and glutathione transferases inhibition, thereby enhancing sensitivity to radiation. It is also cytotoxic to tumor cells and can chemosensitize some alkylating agents by activating their tumor cell killing capabilities. We observed the release characteristics of etanidazole in the dosage forms of microspheres and discs, subjected to different preparation conditions. The release characteristics, morphology changes, particle size, and encapsulation efficiency of microspheres are also investigated. The release rate of etanidazole from implantable discs (13 mm in diameter, 1 mm in thickness, fabricated by a press) is much lower than microspheres due to the reduced specific surface. After the initial burst of 1% release for the first day, the cumulative release within the first week is less than 2% until a secondary burst of release (caused by polymer degradation) occurs after one month. Some key preparation conditions such as drug loadings, disc thickness and diameter, and compression pressure can affect the initial burst of etanidazole from the discs. However, none of them can significantly make the release more uniform. In contrast, the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) can greatly enhance the release rate of discs and also reduces the secondary burst effect, thereby achieving a sustained release for about 2 months.", "answer": "Intracellular glutathione depletion and glutathione transferases inhibition.", "covered": false}

Proton observe frequencies of 250 or 400 MHz proton were used. A copolymer of acrylamide and acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride was used, representative of cationic flocculant polymers possessing quaternary ammonium groups with terminal methyls that provide a sharp singlet at a chemical shift of approximately 3.06 ppm. A strong linear relationship was demonstrated between polymer concentration and either height or area of this peak. Recoveries were up to 96% at higher concentrations (250 mg/L), and were greater than when using viscosity or charge titration methods for polymer determination. Lesser recoveries at lower concentrations (70% at 5 mg/L) were attributed to adsorptive losses. The detection limit of this method was determined to be &lt;0.5 mg/L.

At high altitudes, the reactive oxygen species are continuously generated as a consequence of low oxygen partial pressure (hypoxia), which causes tissue damage. The body's defence system to combat the oxidative stress (e.g., anti-oxidant enzymes, free radical scavengers such as vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, reduced glutathione and minerals such as selenium, etc.) may diminish. In the present study, the antioxidant effect of selenium (Se) in reducing the hypoxia-induced oxidative stress was evaluated by exposing male albino rats to hypoxic stress in a decompression chamber. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in plasma and tissues and a concurrent decrease in blood glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), plasma protein and plasma selenium content when compared with controls. Haemoglobin concentration (Hb%), red blood corpuscles (RBC) and white blood corpuscles (WBC) count were also increased in the hypoxia-exposed group. Selenium supplementation to animals reversed the trend. There was a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.001) in MDA and subsequent increase in plasma and tissue GSH levels. Similarly the blood and tissue GPx and plasma protein also increased significantly in the Se supplemented animals compared with control animals. The Hb%, RBC and WBC counts showed no significant difference between Se-fed and control rats. These results suggest that selenium may help in reducing the lipid peroxidation during hypoxia.", "answer": "Hypoxia increases MDA levels in plasma and tissues.", "covered": false}

{"id": "article-26904_0_1", "question": "What purpose does the penile suspensory ligament serve?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy, Abdomen and Pelvis, Penis -- Introduction. The penis is a male organ that is used for reproduction and urination which is located within the urogenital triangle between the perineal membrane superiorly and deep perineal fascia inferiorly. Its composition divides it into 3 parts: the glans, body, and root. Dorsally, it is composed of the paired corpora cavernosa and ventrally the corpus spongiosum which contains the urethra. The anatomical positions of the penis are according to the erect penis with the dorsal direction being closer to the head and ventral direction being closer to the feet. The tunica albuginea is a fibrous sheet which encapsulates the cavernous body. Buck's fascia, also known as deep fascia of the penis is superficial to the tunica albuginea and is the continuation of the deep perineal fascia which covers the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum together. The spongy urethra is contained within the corpus spongiosum. The crura of the penis is between the 2 corpora cavernosa in the median plane externally. The corpora cavernosa is separated by the septum of the penis internally. The attachment of the penis consists of the bulb, crura, and ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles, which collectively makes up the root of the penis. The bulb of the penis and crura contain erectile tissue. The middle portion of the penis is suspended and known as the body of the penis. The body of the penis lacks muscles and consists mostly of corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and spongy urethra with supporting skin, connective tissue, and blood, lymph, and fascia. The distal part of the penis is known as the glans penis. The proximal portion of the glans is termed the corona. The neck of the corona glans separates it from the body of the penis. The tip of the glans contains the opening to the urethra, known as the meatus. There is loose connective tissue between the thin skin of the penis and the tunica albuginea. The prepuce or foreskin is the second skin layer that covers the glans penis. The frenulum of the prepuce connects it to the urethral surface of the penis glans. The suspensory ligament of the penis is part of the deep fascia that arises from the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis. The fundiform ligament of the penis descends in the midline from the linea alba anterior to the pubic symphysis and splits to surround the penis and then unites and blends inferiorly with the dartos fascia forming the scrotal septum.

In the regulatory analysis of water samples, cyanide content is usually expressed in various forms as free cyanide, total cyanide, weak-acid dissociable cyanide, available cyanide, and cyanide amenable to chlorination. Concentration of individual metal cyanide complex, not furnished in any of these methods, is useful in meaningful assessment of toxicity due to cyanide. In the present work, two macroporous anion-exchange columns, having high and intermediate hydrophobicity, were evaluated to achieve separation of cyano complexes of silver, iron, gold, copper, nickel, and cobalt. On the QS-Al SC column, of high hydrophobicity, the monovalent cyano complexes of silver and gold eluted last while the multivalent cyano complexes, e.g. iron and copper, eluted early. It is suggested that the retention order on this column is due to relative hydrophobicity of the metal cyanide complex, and its affect on ion exchange. In contrast, on the QS-A2 SC column of intermediate hydrophobicity, with the exception of cyano complex with Fe, the separation of the cyano complexes of five other metals closely followed an anion-exchange mechanism. Under gradient conditions, the six metal cyanide complexes were well resolved on the QS-A2 SC column and the method with direct UV detection at 215 nm was accurate (spike recovery of 99.8-118.8%) and precise (RSD of 1.0-2.6%).", "answer": "free cyanide, total cyanide, weak-acid dissociable cyanide, available cyanide, and cyanide amenable to chlorination.", "covered": false}

Elevated DLIS concentrations are encountered in patients with volume-expanded conditions such as uremia, essential hypertension, liver disease, and preeclampsia. DLISs cross-react with antidigoxin antibodies and falsely elevate serum digoxin concentrations, interfering in interpretation of results for therapeutic digoxin monitoring. Falsely lower digoxin values due to the presence of DLISs have been reported. The association of DLISs with volume expansion led to speculation that they could be natriuretic hormones. Several structures have been proposed for DLISs, including nonesterified fatty acid, phospholipid, lysophospholipid, bile acid, bile salt, and steroid. Exogenous DLISs can be found in serum after ingestion of various Chinese medicines and therapy with spironolactone, canrenone, or potassium canrenoate.

To eliminate the interfering physical effect, we investigated the importance of light intensity and culture volume in the algal growth inhibition tests with Desmodesmus subspicatus and three selected dyestuffs. A photon flux density above light saturation is needed to prevent inhibition of algal growth solely due to the light absorption by dyes. Furthermore, a smaller culture volume and moderate shaking of the test flasks is advantageous in that these conditions decrease the influence of the light absorption. At 120 microE s(-1) m(-2), the shading effect of three tested dyes could be eliminated, up to a concentration of 100 mg l(-1). In a mixture with a blue dyestuff, the model toxicant potassium dichromate showed nearly the same EC50 as if applied alone, indicating that the impact of the dye was negligible. Also a small culture volume decreases the inhibition of the average growth rate of Desmodesmus. Thus, by increasing the light intensity and optionally also reducing the culture volume, this method allows a more direct measure of a potential inherent chemical toxicity of coloured substances to algae. Additionally, high light intensities and lower culture volumes result in lower coefficients of variation, which improves the sensitivity of the test for the statistical calculation of toxicity data.", "answer": "High light intensity is necessary to prevent growth inhibition in algal tests with coloured substances due to physical shading, allowing for a more accurate assessment of chemical toxicity.", "covered": false}

Acrokeratoelastoidosis (AKE) of Oswaldo Costa, or inverse papular acrokeratosis , is a rare autosomal-dominant genodermatosis first described in 1952 by Oswaldo Costa, a Brazilian dermatologist. [1] It characteristically presents with flesh-colored papules on the lateral areas of the palms, soles, and dorsum of hands. Acrokeratoelastoidosis is a type of marginal keratoderma that principally affects the lateral portion of the palmoplantar regions [Figures 1 (A) and (B)] . Apart from inherited cases, there are reports of sporadic occurrences of this condition. [2] The histological features are hyalinized and homogenous collagen, hyperkeratosis,  and a decrease in, and fragmentation of the elastic fibers (elastorrhexis). [3] This rare form of focal acral keratoderma of unknown cause typically begins during childhood, although onset may delay until adolescence. As per the limited published literature on this condition, there seems to be no gender or racial predilection. Another reason for some patients seeking a dermatologist's opinion a few years after the onset is the asymptomatic nature of the lesions. The condition requires differentiation from two sets of disorders: 1) other marginal and focal acral keratodermas, and 2) distinct disorders such as acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf. Histopathological findings aid in differentiation between acrokeratoelastoidosis and other clinical simulators. There is no reported morbidity, and apart from cosmetic concerns of some patients, the overall prognosis of AKE is good. [3] [4]", "answer": "childhood or adolescence.", "covered": true}

Chromium is a primary drinking water contaminant in the USA with hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), being the most toxic form of the metal. As a required step in developing a revised state drinking water standard for chromium, the California Department of Health Services recently issued a new Public Health Goal (PHG) of 2.5 microg/l for total chromium and 0.2 microg/l for Cr(VI). Hexavalent chromium can be determined (as chromate) by ion chromatography, as described in US Evironmental Protection Agency Method 218.6; however, the method as originally published does not allow sufficient sensitivity for analysis at the California PHG level of 0.2 microg/l. Modification of the conditions described in Method 218.6, including the use of a lower eluent flow-rate, larger reaction coil, and larger injection volume, significantly increases the method sensitivity. The modified method, which uses IonPac NG1 and AS7 guard and analytical columns, an eluent of 250 mM ammonium sulfate-100 mM ammonium hydroxide operated at 1.0 ml/min, a 1000 microl injection volume, and postcolumn reaction with 2 mM diphenylcarbazide-10% methanol-0.5 M sulfuric acid (using a 750 microl reaction coil) followed by UV-Vis detection at 530 nm, permits a method detection limit for chromate of 0.02 microg/l.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the antivascular and antitumor effects of AC-7700 on rat hepatoma. AH-130 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, were solidified and implanted into the liver of Donryu rats. Vascularity of the liver tumor was directly identified by in-vivo fluorescence microscopy from 0 to 60 min after the injection of 10 mg/kg AC-7700. To observe the antivascular effect of AC-7700, the vascular density of the tumor was measured and assessed as the ratio of preinjection to postinjection values. The antitumor effects were evaluated with histopathologic findings and analysis of animal survival. In-vivo microscopic observation showed that tumor perfusion diminished within 30 min after AC-7700 administration.

Non-viral vector mediated gene transfer, compared to viral vector mediated one, is a promising tool for the safe delivery of therapeutic DNA in genetic and acquired human diseases. Although the lack of specific immune response favor the clinical application of non-viral vectors, comprising of an expression cassette complexed to cationic liposome or cationic polymer, the limited efficacy and short duration of transgene expression impose major hurdles in the widespread application of non-viral gene therapy. The trafficking of transgene, complexed with chemical vectors, has been the subject of intensive investigations to improve our understanding of cellular and extracellular barriers impeding gene delivery. Here, we review those physical and metabolic impediments that account, at least in part, for the inefficient translocation of transgene into the nucleus of target cells. Following the internalization of the DNA-polycation complex by endocytosis, a large fraction is targeted to the lysosomal compartment by default. Since the cytosolic release of heterelogous DNA is a prerequisite for nuclear translocation, entrapment and degradation of plasmid DNA in endo-lysosomes constitute a major impediment to efficient gene transfer. Only a small fraction of internalized plasmid DNA penetrates the cytoplasm. Plasmid DNA encounters the diffusional and metabolic barriers of the cytoplasm, further decreasing the number of intact plasmid molecules reaching the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the gateway of nucleosol. Nuclear translocation of DNA requires either the disassembly of the nuclear envelope or active nuclear transport via the NPC. Comparison of viral and plasmid DNA cellular trafficking should reveal strategies that viruses have developed to overcome those cellular barriers that impede non-viral DNA delivery in gene therapy attempts.", "answer": "Diffusional and metabolic barriers in the cytoplasm decrease the number of intact plasmid molecules reaching the NPC, thus affecting the efficacy of non-viral gene delivery.", "covered": false}

Metal adsorption and surface charge determinations were performed previously on well-characterised Sphagnum and Carex peat samples. The aim of this investigation was to determine metal adsorption from complex wastewaters onto these peat samples and compare it to the adsorption onto peat granules, clinoptilolite, glauconite and a flue dust from steel production. A sulphide mine leachate, a landfill leachate and a laundry wastewater were chosen, giving a variation in pH, ionic strength, total organic carbon and concentrations of metals. Metal adsorption was determined in batch and column experiments. The wastewater composition was of great importance for metal removal efficiency, mainly due to the difference in dominating metal species. In the sulphide mine leachate, containing free metal ions, a high metal adsorption was observed onto both peat and inorganic adsorbents. In the landfill leachate the metals formed carbonate and organic complexes and a low metal removal was achieved. Contrary to the leachates, the laundry wastewater contained suspended particles. The high amount of metals removed, 80% of the Cu and 30-60% of the Zn concentration, was probably withdrawn bound to the particle fraction. The highest removal of metal ions was obtained in the sulphide mine leachate with Carex peat, removing 97-99% of the Zn and 85-100% of the Cu content.

Reactive Orange 96 by sulfide. The mechanism of decolorization of azo dyes based on the extracellular chemical reduction with sulfide (H2S, HS-, S2-) was postulated for sulfate reducing environments. To design technical decolorization processes of textile wastewater treatment with sulfide produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), kinetics is of great significance. Batch experiments were made in order to investigate the kinetics of abiotic decolorization of the reactive mono-azo dye C.I. Reactive Orange 96 (RO 96) with sulfide, with varying pH. The decolorization of RO 96 by sulfide under the exclusion of O2 corresponded to first-order kinetics with respect to both dye and sulfide concentration. The decolorization of RO 96 with sulfide at neutral pH (7.1) was advantageous compared with that at pH for 4.1, 6.3, and 6.5. This is attributed to an increase in the fraction of HS- of total sulfide species at neutral pH. The rate constants k for the decolorization at 37 degrees C were obtained as 0.01 for pH = 4.1, 0.06 for pH = 6.3, 0.08 for pH = 6.5, and 0.09 for pH = 7.1 in mM(-1) min(-1).

Within this theoretical framework we consider here a difficult case of classification of species: the Callithrix jacchus group of the New World monkeys. Although the morphological analysis strongly suggests the individuation of six different species, nevertheless several experiments of crossing give evidence to fertility of hybrids. Since both the morphological and the hybridological criteria have shown to be of enormous importance in actual classification of species, this apparent contradiction seems very disappointing. Our axiomatization of speciation processes as operations acting in special time intervals permits to avoid the contradiction by allowing for individuals which, during such special periods, may belong to more than one species.

[39] In traumatic uveitis, there can be microbial contamination and retention of necrotic debris at the site of trauma, resulting from a florid inflammatory response in the anterior segment of the eye. In infectious uveitis, the pathophysiological mechanism is immune-mediated destruction of foreign antigens that may cause damage to the uveal tissue, vessels, and cells.

Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) is a non-pathogenic human parvovirus that is being developed as a gene therapy vector for the treatment of numerous diseases. One property of wild-type AAV-2, that is highly desirable in a gene therapy vector, is its ability to preferentially integrate its DNA into a 4 kilobase region of human chromosome 19, designated AAVS1. One disadvantage of AAV-2 is its relatively small packaging capacity, approximately 4.7 kilobases. Because of this size limitation, the AAV-2 rep and cap genes were removed from first-generation AAV-2-based gene therapy vectors to make room for the therapeutic or marker gene. It was later discovered that the rep gene, or at least one of its products, the Rep68 or Rep78 protein, is required for preferential integration of AAV-2. Recent developments in AAV-2 gene therapy vector construction allow the inclusion of the rep gene into a second generation of AAV-2-based gene therapy systems. These new systems fall into four major categories: plasmid-based systems, co-transduction with multiple AAV-2 vectors, incorporation of the AAV-2 vector into a larger virus, and in vitro packaging.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a tetrameric enzyme that has been used as a model for labile protein drugs. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) have been proposed as excipients to stabilize labile proteins in solution and during the freezing portion of the lyophilization cycle. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PEG molecular weight and concentration on the activity of LDH. In general, PEG protection increases with PEG molecular weight and concentration. PEGs slow the loss of activity in LDH solutions stored at 4 degrees C, but are not sufficiently effective to allow for a solution product. PEGs 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 show full freezing protection at less than 0.01%, while lower molecular weight PEGs need higher concentrations to produce protection upon freezing. Circular dichroism (CD) studies of LDH solutions before and after freezing with PEG 400 and PEG 8000 confirm the activity studies. The CD spectrum of LDH before freezing shows the classic alpha helix pattern. After unprotected LDH solution is frozen and thawed, the CD spectrum erodes. Low concentrations of PEG 8000 (1% or less) preserve the alpha helix profile after freezing of the samples. PEG 400 preserves the alpha helix CD profile in a stepwise fashion with increasing concentrations.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_635_2", "question": "What combination of vitamins has shown a significant reduction in tumor recurrence in a double-blind trial for bladder cancer chemoprevention?", "doc_chunk": "Chemoprevention of bladder cancer. The data presented herein, although highly supportive for a protective role of various nutrients against bladder cancer, are far from definitive. Many authorities question the validity of current recommendations for nutritional chemoprevention against bladder cancer. The reason for the wide variations reported in epidemiologic studies lies in the nature of observational studies. Dietary studies are limited in their conclusions because the protection afforded by the consumption of a particular nutrient may be multifactorial, with different components of the food exerting potential chemopreventive effects. Furthermore, measuring levels of nutrients in the food intake of populations is confounded by factors that might affect these levels and also the incidence of cancer. For example, vitamin A can come from animal or vegetarian sources. Because animal fat has been identified as a potential carcinogen in man, depending on the source of the vitamin, varying levels of protection might be deduced. In addition, chemoprevention studies using dietary supplements are expected to have mild effects, and large studies would be required to confirm statistical significance. Even with agents such as intravesical chemotherapy, only half the studies achieve statistical significance [29]. Prospective randomized trials with a large sample size, longer follow-up, and an extended duration of treatment are needed to clarify the association between micronutrients and cancer protection. With these caveats in mind, several recommendations can be made. Simple measures, such as drinking more fluids (especially water), can have a profound impact on the incidence of bladder cancer. Vitamins are being extensively studied in chemopreventive trials for different cancers. There is strong evidence for a chemoprotective effect of vitamin A in bladder cancer. The authors recommend 32,000 IU/day of vitamin A initially, with lower doses (24,000 IU) for persons less than 50 kg. Because liver toxicity is a possibility with long-term administration, the dose should be decreased to 16,000 IU after 3 years. High doses of beta-carotene should be avoided based on a large clinical trial reporting a 25% increase in the number of cases of prostate cancer and a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer. Vitamin B6 has been studied in several clinical trials in bladder cancer. The US-based Veterans Administration cooperative study found benefit for vitamin B6 when given as a single agent. Data for vitamins C and E are insufficient to recommend either agent as stand-alone treatment. Nonetheless, each of these vitamins is known to have beneficial effects, including improved function of the immune system. It is possible that only a small percentage of patients with bladder cancer respond to vitamins B6, C, or E, yet each is safe, nontoxic, and inexpensive. In an effort to pool the efficacy of individual agents and to increase the power of study, the authors evaluated the combination of vitamins A, B6, C, and E in a double-blind trial. The observed 50% 5-year reduction in tumor recurrence was highly significant and greater than would be expected for any of the individual ingredients and suggests that combinations of nutritional agents may be most appropriate. A large-volume study along similar lines is being conducted. Among the numerous other compounds and dietary substances purported to have chemopreventive effect, soybeans, garlic, and green tea stand out as having the greatest promise and can freely be recommended to patients. For synthetically synthesized agents such as celecoxib, piroxicam, or DFMO, recommendations must be deferred until the results of clinical trials are conclusively in favor of their use. Many of the dietary factors found to be protective against bladder cancer are being investigated in other cancers and are beneficial to general health. Although naturally occurring nutrients are ideal, especially because the delicate balance of various micronutrients might be impossible to synthesize in the laboratory, the general population finds it easier to take vitamin supplements. Unfortunately, dietary changes such as decreasing fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake are more difficult to initiate. There is a mistaken notion that simply because an agent is naturally occurring, it cannot be as beneficial as taking a substance synthesized in the laboratory. Even in a high-risk group such as nuclear-bomb survivors in Japan, high consumption of vegetables and fruit is protective against bladder cancer [44].

The current report analyses the expression pattern of ICAM-1 in primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and in the rat lung following instillation of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) in order to better define the role of alveolar epithelial ICAM-1. AECs stimulated in vitro with LPS were evaluated for ICAM-1 and ICAM-1 messenger ribonucleic acid content. Adherence assays with neutrophils and macrophages were performed. Endotoxin-induced ICAM-1 upregulation on AECs was demonstrated in vivo by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, the effect of intratracheally-instilled anti-ICAM-1 was assessed. Significant upregulation of ICAM-1 occurred in vitro and in vivo on AECs after LPS stimulation. Adherence assays showed a 114% increase in adhesion of neutrophils to AECs.

Non-viral vector mediated gene transfer, compared to viral vector mediated one, is a promising tool for the safe delivery of therapeutic DNA in genetic and acquired human diseases. Although the lack of specific immune response favor the clinical application of non-viral vectors, comprising of an expression cassette complexed to cationic liposome or cationic polymer, the limited efficacy and short duration of transgene expression impose major hurdles in the widespread application of non-viral gene therapy. The trafficking of transgene, complexed with chemical vectors, has been the subject of intensive investigations to improve our understanding of cellular and extracellular barriers impeding gene delivery. Here, we review those physical and metabolic impediments that account, at least in part, for the inefficient translocation of transgene into the nucleus of target cells. Following the internalization of the DNA-polycation complex by endocytosis, a large fraction is targeted to the lysosomal compartment by default. Since the cytosolic release of heterelogous DNA is a prerequisite for nuclear translocation, entrapment and degradation of plasmid DNA in endo-lysosomes constitute a major impediment to efficient gene transfer. Only a small fraction of internalized plasmid DNA penetrates the cytoplasm. Plasmid DNA encounters the diffusional and metabolic barriers of the cytoplasm, further decreasing the number of intact plasmid molecules reaching the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the gateway of nucleosol. Nuclear translocation of DNA requires either the disassembly of the nuclear envelope or active nuclear transport via the NPC. Comparison of viral and plasmid DNA cellular trafficking should reveal strategies that viruses have developed to overcome those cellular barriers that impede non-viral DNA delivery in gene therapy attempts.", "answer": "The lysosomal compartment impedes non-viral gene transfer by entrapping and degrading plasmid DNA, reducing the amount that can reach the nucleus.", "covered": false}

Coronary angioplasty should be based on documented ischemia. However, in daily clinical practice the indication for angioplasty is often based on eyeball assessment of the severity of the stenosis. This study was performed to assess the accuracy of eyeball estimation of coronary stenosis when taking functional flow reserve (FFR) as gold standard. Study lesions were where no mutual agreement on the severity of the stenosis was obtained. The procedure consisted of a repeat control angiogram, FFR measurement and in case of FFR&lt;75% percutaneous coronary intervention. The eyeball assessment of the stenosis was written down before further execution of the procedure. FFR was measured with a pressure monitoring guide. Maximal myocardial hyperemia was induced by intravenous adenosine infusion. Fifty-two patients were studied. Agreement between eyeball assessment and FFR existed in a total of 36 cases (69.2%). Over estimation of hemodynamic severity occurred in six cases (11.5%) and under estimation in 10 cases (19.2%).

Sodium carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases are preferred over sodium hydroxide for anion analysis by suppressor-based ion chromatography (IC). Unlike hydroxide, carbonate-hydrogencarbonate has strong eluting power and its buffering capacity can be used as a selectivity tool for controlling separations. However, carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases fell out of favor for trace level analysis because the carbonic acid suppressor effluent has some background conductivity, which reduces sensitivity compared to sodium hydroxide. This paper describes a new suppressor technology that improved anion analysis with carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases. In addition to converting the carbonate-hydrogencarbonate buffer to carbonic acid like other traditional IC suppressors, the new DS-Plus suppressor also removed carbonic acid from the suppressor effluent. Anions are now detected in water background, just like when using sodium hydroxide as the mobile phase. The lower background conductivity improves sensitivity and reduces detection limits. The water-dip often seen with conventional suppressors is greatly reduced, improving fluoride quantification.", "answer": "The DS-Plus suppressor reduces background conductivity, thereby improving sensitivity and lowering detection limits in anion analysis.", "covered": false}

In the regulatory analysis of water samples, cyanide content is usually expressed in various forms as free cyanide, total cyanide, weak-acid dissociable cyanide, available cyanide, and cyanide amenable to chlorination. Concentration of individual metal cyanide complex, not furnished in any of these methods, is useful in meaningful assessment of toxicity due to cyanide. In the present work, two macroporous anion-exchange columns, having high and intermediate hydrophobicity, were evaluated to achieve separation of cyano complexes of silver, iron, gold, copper, nickel, and cobalt. On the QS-Al SC column, of high hydrophobicity, the monovalent cyano complexes of silver and gold eluted last while the multivalent cyano complexes, e.g. iron and copper, eluted early. It is suggested that the retention order on this column is due to relative hydrophobicity of the metal cyanide complex, and its affect on ion exchange. In contrast, on the QS-A2 SC column of intermediate hydrophobicity, with the exception of cyano complex with Fe, the separation of the cyano complexes of five other metals closely followed an anion-exchange mechanism. Under gradient conditions, the six metal cyanide complexes were well resolved on the QS-A2 SC column and the method with direct UV detection at 215 nm was accurate (spike recovery of 99.8-118.8%) and precise (RSD of 1.0-2.6%).", "answer": "Spike recovery range: 99.8-118.8%, Precision (RSD): 1.0-2.6%.", "covered": false}

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_642_2", "question": "How can false-positive and false-negative results from tumor markers impact the quality of life for patients undergoing bladder cancer surveillance?", "doc_chunk": "Current concepts of tumor markers in bladder cancer. The critical issue in characterizing the usefulness of tumor markers in screening or monitoring for urothelial cancer and in determining prognosis revolves around the question, \"What do we need to know?\" During surveillance of patients with low-risk disease, highly sensitive markers may detect disease persistence or early recurrence (on the basis of field-effect changes or tumor cell implantation); however, they may not indicate the possibility of progression. If cystoscopy is negative in these instances, is it appropriate to treat? Does earlier treatment actually prevent recurrence or progression? Some investigators have suggested a positive answer to the former question, although lead-time bias may a role. The issue in the latter question may be moot because low-risk disease is by definition unlikely to progress. A corresponding question is whether one should treat the patient if the marker has a low specificity. In such instances, a marker with low specificity may incur more frequent instrumentation and a panoply of additional costs. A marker may have some value in providing earlier diagnosis in low-risk disease if treatments are available to prevent clinical expression and recurrence. A tumor marker would have additional value if it could detect biologic change from low-risk to high-risk disease and permit a corresponding change in treatment. Moreover, if a marker could provide earlier diagnosis in high-risk disease, it might permit identification of those patients likely to progress at earlier and curable stages of disease. To be successful, such markers must have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis. It has been suggested that \"a simple noninvasive highly sensitive and specific method for detecting bladder cancer would decrease the morbidity associated with current surveillance methods, improve quality of life for patients, and reduce costs by substituting a less expensive test for the more expensive endoscopic procedures\" (Dr. M. Soloway, personal communication 2000). In considering this statement, it is tempting to question some of its implications. The term \"simple\" suggests that point-of-care tests may be the easiest, but tests that are available may be inconsistent and not sufficiently sensitive or specific. The need for a \"highly sensitive and specific\" test is of critical importance for applicability in the individual, even when such tests are based on the results in large populations. When considering the \"morbidity of current methods,\" it is tempting to question whether cystoscopy is that morbid a procedure. Given the information it provides, it seems improbable that it can be readily replaced. Currently, no markers provide information over and above that provided by cystoscopy and histology- or cytology-based understanding of the biology of the disease especially in considering distinctions between low-risk and high-risk disease. The ability to \"improve quality of life\" will depend on the use of the predictive value made on the basis of a test's sensitivity and specificity. A false-positive test may lead to anxiety and extensive unnecessary evaluation, whereas a false-negative test may lead to missed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and the possibility of disease progression until accurate diagnosis is obtained. In each case, quality of life is compromised. \"Substituting a less expensive test\" depends on the benefits of that substitution and the practicality of omitting or delaying standard assessment. Costs depend on the frequency of testing, those incurred by false-positive tests, and those incurred by false-negative tests. Several caveats emerge when taking into account these various considerations. In screening for low-risk disease, the urgency of diagnosis may be less important. High sensitivity is of less importance because the risk of a missed diagnosis has less ominous repercussions. Nevertheless, high specificity is important to avoid unnecessary frequent instrumentations. In considering surveillance for low-risk disease, cytology may be more useful in indicating a change from negative (persistent or recurrent low-risk disease) to positive (high-risk disease) with the consequent need for more aggressive treatment approach. No urinary \"screening\" markers reliably provide this information. In considering surveillance for high-risk disease, sensitive markers would detect persistence or early recurrence. If such markers are negative, intervals between repeated cystoscopies may be prolonged; however, a high specificity is needed to ensure the validity of a truly negative interpretation. Otherwise, diagnosis may be missed and the risk from progression and the development of incurability increased. Markers for urothelial cancer must be expressed exclusively as a consequence of the presence of cancer cells. The test must be sensitive in detecting disease and must be validated in nonselected populations. It must be sensitive in excluding nondisease, and noncancer conditions must have little influence on its accuracy. There must be little or no interassay or intra-assay variability. Interpretation of an assay for a tumor marker should be all or none, or based on a threshold level. The assays must have sufficient sensitivity and specificity in populations and in the individual to have practical clinical applicability.", "answer": "False-positive results can cause unnecessary anxiety and medical procedures, impacting quality of life negatively, while false-negative results can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of disease progression and severely affecting quality of life.", "covered": false}

An 1-year study of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill found that spill residues on the oiled shorelines rapidly lost toxicity through weathering. After 1990, toxicity of sediments remained at only a few heavily oiled, isolated locations in Prince William Sound (AK, USA), as measured by a standard amphipod bioassay using Rhepoxynius abronius. Data from 648 sediment samples taken during the 1990 to 1993 period were statistically analyzed to determine the relationship between the total concentration of 39 parent and methyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (defined as total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [TPAH]) and amphipod mortality and the effect of oil weathering on toxicity. A logistic regression model yielded estimates of the lower threshold, LC10 (lethal concentration to 10% of the population), and LC50 (median lethal concentration) values of 2,600, 4,100, and 10,750 ng/g TPAH (dry wt), respectively. Estimates of the threshold and LC50 values in this field study relate well to corresponding sediment quality guideline (SQG) values reported in the literature. For sediment TPAH concentrations &gt;2,600 ng/g, samples with high mortality values (&gt;90%) had relatively high fractions of naphthalenes and those with low mortality (&lt;20%) had relatively high fractions of chrysenes. By 1999, the median sediment TPAH concentration of 117 ng/g for the post-1989 worst-case sites studied were well below the 2,600 ng/g toxicity threshold value, confirming the lack of potential for long-term toxic effects. Analysis of biological community structure parameters for sediment samples taken concurrently found that species richness and Shannon diversity decreased with increasing TPAH above the 2,600 ng/g threshold, demonstrating a correspondence between sediment bioassay results and biological community effects in the field. The low probability of exposure to toxic concentrations of weathered spill residues at the worst-case sites sampled in this study is consistent with the rapid overall recovery of shoreline biota observed in 1990 to 1991.", "answer": "LC50 value for TPAH concentration in sediments is 10,750 ng/g.", "covered": false}

A population of the nonmigratory estuarine fish species Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog) indigenous to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated Superfund site (New Bedford Harbor, MA, USA) demonstrated an inherited tolerance to local, dioxinlike contaminants (DLCs). These findings suggest that DLCs have acted as selective agents, allowing the survival of only the most tolerant individuals, forming DLC-adapted populations. We hypothesized that DLC-tolerant mummichog populations would reside where local conditions are toxic to sensitive individuals, and that toxic environmental conditions could be predicted based on responses of sensitive early life stages to laboratory exposures of DLCs. As a measure of DLC tolerance, progeny of field-collected fish were tested in the laboratory with a dioxinlike PCB congener, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). Mummichog populations were collected from sites with sediment PCB concentrations predicted to range from nontoxic to toxic. Consistent with predictions, tolerant populations were indigenous to sites with elevated sediment PCB concentrations. Also, as predicted, DLC-tolerant populations were resident to sites far less contaminated than the Superfund site. These results suggest that exposures to persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic contaminants may produce evolutionary effects on a geographic scale larger than previously envisioned.

Lead concentrations in tree rings of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sampled at a parkland in north-west England were measured in wood formed since the mid-1800s. Concentrations of Pb in Scots pine and oak peaked in wood formed between 1900 and 1940, most likely because of Pb accumulation in heartwood, indicating that oak and Scots pine are unsuitable for monitoring temporal changes in Pb deposition at the study site. In contrast, Pb concentrations in sycamore, a species that has similar heartwood and sapwood chemistry, were relatively constant in wood formed between the mid-1800s and 1950. Lead concentrations decreased steadily in sycamore tree rings formed after the 1950s, and decreased more abruptly in wood formed after 1985. This sharp decrease in wood Pb cannot be due to decreases in soil Pb concentration. Stable Pb isotope analysis was used to further investigate Pb patterns in sycamore wood. Excess 206Pb/207Pb ratios in tree-rings of sycamore were relatively constant, approximately 1.17, in wood formed prior to the 1930s, but decreased steadily thereafter reaching a minimum value of approximately 1.16 in wood formed between 1975 and 1985 after which time 206Pb/207Pb ratios increased. This pattern is consistent with changes in Pb isotope ratios measured in peat, sediment and aerosol samples in the UK. However, the magnitude of the decrease in 206Pb/207Pb (largely due to gasoline Pb) is considerably lower than in other studies and our estimates indicate that less than 20% of the total Pb in sycamore wood measured since the mid-1800s is derived from gasoline emissions. A more likely explanation for the pattern of Pb observed in sycamore tree rings is that soil Pb accumulates within rings of the diffuse porous wood over a number of years. Such uptake patterns would result in lower Pb concentrations in the outer (more recently formed) tree rings, which coincide with recent reductions in Pb deposition in the UK.

In this study, we explored the expression of nephrin in the developmental kidney in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at different time points, from day 5 after birth to adulthood. Real time RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to assess and quantify gene and protein expression of nephrin in the kidney. SHR had hypertension at week 10 and albuminuria at week 20. Nephrin expression in both SHR and WKY increased from day 5 to adulthood. Furthermore, both gene and protein expression of nephrin were significantly lower in SHR after birth when compared to WKY at the same age.

Understanding the biomechanical effect of various factors on knee behavior after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or reconstruction is instrumental for the development of an optimal surgical treatment of ACL injury that can better restore normal knee function. This paper presents the application of a three-dimensional (3D) computational knee model for parametric studies of knee kinematics in response to simulated muscle loads. The knee model was constructed using the magnetic resonance images and biomechanical experimental data of the same cadaveric human knee specimen. The kinematics of the knee predicted by the computational model was compared with that measured from different specimens in a wide range of loading conditions and flexion angles. In general, the model predictions were within the range of experimental data. The model was then used to predict knee motion, ligament forces, and contact pressure in response to a simulated quadriceps force when the knee was ACL deficient. Partial ACL injury was simulated by reducing the stiffness of the ACL in the model. The results demonstrated that even with a reduction of 75% of the ACL stiffness, the ACL still carried a significant amount of the load (more than 58%) carried by an intact ACL. The kinematics (both tibial translation and rotation) varied less than 20% compared to that of the knee with intact ACL. The 3D computational model can be a powerful tool to simulate different variables that would influence knee function after ACL reconstruction, such as the initial tension of the ACL graft, the insertion sites of the graft, multibundle grafts, graft materials, and various physiological loading conditions.", "answer": "To conduct parametric studies of knee kinematics in response to simulated muscle loads and to understand the biomechanical effects of ACL injury or reconstruction for developing optimal surgical treatments.", "covered": false}

Over the past decade, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have been managed with preoperative chemoradiation. Patients achieving a complete clinical response to preoperative chemoradiation have had better pelvic tumor control, sphincterpreservation, and overall survival than those with gross residual disease. Some patients achieving a complete clinical response have even had rectal-preserving surgery (full-thickness local excision). These results emphasize the importance of maximizing tumor response. Further improvement in response and survival could be achieved by using novel chemotherapeutic agents or through tumor-selective molecular targeting strategies that enhance the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) is a novel chemotherapy agent being evaluated clinically as a radiosensitizing agent in rectal cancer. Inhibition of several molecular targets-such as epidermal growth factor receptor, ras oncogene activation, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, and neoangiogenesis-appears to be tumor-selective in preclinical models. COX-2 expression has been shown to enhance cytotoxic therapy in preclinical models. In vitro and in vivo studies show that selective COX-2 inhibition enhances the effects of radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. COX-2 is also markedly upregulated in human colorectal cancer and appears to be associated with adverse patient prognosis.

In the present study, the antioxidant effect of selenium (Se) in reducing the hypoxia-induced oxidative stress was evaluated by exposing male albino rats to hypoxic stress in a decompression chamber. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in plasma and tissues and a concurrent decrease in blood glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), plasma protein and plasma selenium content when compared with controls. Haemoglobin concentration (Hb%), red blood corpuscles (RBC) and white blood corpuscles (WBC) count were also increased in the hypoxia-exposed group. Selenium supplementation to animals reversed the trend. There was a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.001) in MDA and subsequent increase in plasma and tissue GSH levels.

This study is an update on the lung cancer risk of mild-steel welders with no asbestos exposure using a cohort of nonwelders for comparison. The subjects came from three United States (US) plants that manufactured heavy equipment. The follow-up was extended from 1988 to 1998. The welders were not exposed to asbestos (typical of shipyard welders) or to chromium or nickel (present in stainless steel). There were 108 lung cancer deaths among the welders and 128 such deaths among the nonwelders (double the previous number of lung cancer deaths). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung cancer was 1.46 [95% confidence interval (95% CI 1.20-1.76] for the welders and 1.18 (95% CI 0.98-1.40) for the nonwelders, both in comparison with the US general population. Direct comparison between the welders and nonwelders yielded a rate ratio of 1.22 (95% CI 0.93-1.59). Analyses using a 15-year lag time did not differ greatly from those of an unlagged analysis. There were no marked trends for lung cancer risk by duration of exposure or latency. Evidence from cross-sectional data from a sample of the cohort indicated that the welders smoked somewhat more than the US population and more than the nonwelders. An approximate adjustment of the rate ratios for possible confounding by smoking suggested that smoking may have accounted for about half of the excess lung cancer observed among the welders versus that of either reference population. CONCLUSIONS These data provide suggestive but not conclusive evidence of a modest lung cancer risk from mild-steel welding.", "answer": "1.46 for welders and 1.18 for nonwelders.", "covered": false}

The problem of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty remains the major limiting factor of the procedure. Over the last 10 years, investigators have been studying the use of radiation therapy for preventing restenosis after angioplasty or stent placement. Since radiotherapy has been proven in other cases to be effective in disrupting the cell cycle regulatory proteins and thereby slowing or stopping growth, it was decided to apply the same principle to neointimal hyperplasia. To review the data that have emerged regarding vascular radiation with an emphasis on irradiated stents, 65 articles were reviewed and both preclinical and clinical experiments were included. Overall, studies with gamma and beta radiation show promising results. Endovascular gamma radiation has been shown effective in randomized trials, even at 3-year follow-up. Beta radiation is preferred because of greater safety and localization, and because it has also shown encouraging results in initial clinical trials, as well as in larger randomized studies. Consequently, the Federal Drug Administration has approved the use of both. In both types of endovascular brachytherapy, it seems the greater the dose, the better the initial response. Safety concerns include an increased incidence of late thrombosis and greater restenosis at margins. With irradiated stents, however, the situation is not as clear. At times, animal models have presented confusing results. These have ranged from significant suppression of hyperplasia to outright adverse effects of radiation on the vessel wall. While some clinical trials have been encouraging, others have not. Follow-up of up to 1 year has been disappointing so far. Many issues, such as the \"candy wrapper\" effect and rebound hyperplasia, must be dealt with before this becomes a viable form of therapy. It has become clear that radiation therapy in this setting, while having potentially great benefits, can cause deleterious effects as well. However, the mixed bag of positive and negative results seen so far, and the attractiveness of stents or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty being \"restenosis-proofed,\" eventually is cause for cautious optimism.", "answer": "Beta radiation is preferred in preventing restenosis after angioplasty due to its greater safety and better localization.", "covered": false}

Performing gene hunting using differential display-polymerase chain reaction, a downregulated sequence in the frontal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) with AD-like neuropathology was identified as a-NAC with 100% homology. The significant decrease in alpha-NAC mRNA was shown by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in parallel, the significant decrease of alpha-NAC protein, which was even more pronounced when related to either actin or neuron-specific enolase levels, was also observed in both disorders. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong, significant correlation between alpha-NAC protein and mRNA expression. In fetal DS brain, however, mRNA levels of alpha-NAC were comparable between DS and controls, suggesting that the decrease in alpha-NAC might be involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. The decrease in alpha-NAC as a transcriptional coactivator could contribute to the characteristic decline of the c-Jun-mediated transcriptional machinery and could function as the complementary mechanism in c-Jun-mediated apoptosis.

Pastoral Pool activity was investigated using confidential record sheets stating the frequency, duration and content of each PP encounter. Students were aware of the PP and many would consider using it. Staff and students agreed over the functions of the PP. Students frequently expressed concerns over confidentiality within the system. Uptake was low, with only 3% of students approaching the PP and the majority of PP work performed by only two staff members. The content of meetings was often multifactorial and usually on a subject within the PP remit. The PP is beneficial because pastoral care is provided only by dedicated staff members with an interest in student welfare. Membership is small enough to enable staff training and development. However, the system relies on self-referral by students. Rather than preventing problems arising, it therefore provides secondary support to those students insightful enough to identify their problems and motivated enough to seek help.", "answer": "Confidentiality.", "covered": false}

There has been great improvement in increasing access to various forms of LARC in recent years. However, some barriers remain, especially for nulliparous women and adolescents. There are groups of healthcare providers that have not been fully educated on the use of LARC in nulliparous patients, including adolescents. There is evidence to suggest that these methods should be encouraged in these populations because of their reversibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the barriers that remain for adolescents and nulliparous women include unfamiliarity and/or discomfort with the device, initial cost of device and insertion, lack of parental acceptance, and unfamiliarity of the healthcare provider providing the consultation. However, research has shown that when patients are educated at length on the various forms of contraception available with no worry of cost, 67% of women chose a form of LARC, with 56% choosing an IUD. [19] [Level 3] Therefore, as healthcare providers, it is imperative to stay up-to-date on guidelines for improving access to critical healthcare for patients. For example, there had been studies that showed nulliparous women should not be started on IUDs because of an inherent risk of pelvic inflammatory disorder, leading to future infertility. However, these reports have since been refuted and show that these devices are safe for nulliparous women to use.

The goal of this study was to identify the relative toxicity of ambient areas in the Chesapeake Bay watershed by using a suite of concurrent water column and sediment toxicity tests at seventy-five ambient stations in 20 Chesapeake Bay rivers from 1990 through 1999. Spatial and temporal variability was examined at selected locations throughout the 10 yr study. Inorganic and organic contaminants were evaluated in ambient water and sediment concurrently with water column and sediment tests to assess possible causes of toxicity although absolute causality can not be established. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to develop a multiple endpoint toxicity index (TOX-INDEX) at each station for both water column and sediment toxicity data. Water column tests from the 10 yr testing period showed that 49% of the time, some degree of toxicity was reported. The most toxic sites based on water column results were located in urbanized areas such as the Anacostia River, Elizabeth River and the Middle River. Water quality criteria for copper, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc were exceeded at one or more of these sites. Water column toxicity was also reported in localized areas of the South and Chester Rivers. Both spatial and temporal variability was reported from the suite of water column toxicity tests. Some degree of sediment toxicity was reported from 62% of the tests conducted during the ten year period. The Elizabeth River and Baltimore Harbor stations were reported as the most toxic areas based on sediment results. Sediment toxicity guidelines were exceeded for one or more of the following metals at these two locations: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc. At the Elizabeth River stations nine of sixteen semi-volatile organics and two of seven pesticides measured exceeded the ER-M values in 1990. Ambient sediment toxicity tests in the Elizabeth River in 1996 showed reduced toxicity. Various semi-volatile organics exceeded the ER-M values at a number of Baltimore Harbor sites; pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene were particularly high at one of the stations (Northwest Harbor).

In the present study, the antioxidant effect of selenium (Se) in reducing the hypoxia-induced oxidative stress was evaluated by exposing male albino rats to hypoxic stress in a decompression chamber. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in plasma and tissues and a concurrent decrease in blood glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), plasma protein and plasma selenium content when compared with controls. Haemoglobin concentration (Hb%), red blood corpuscles (RBC) and white blood corpuscles (WBC) count were also increased in the hypoxia-exposed group. Selenium supplementation to animals reversed the trend. There was a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.001) in MDA and subsequent increase in plasma and tissue GSH levels.

The aim of the present study was to determine if RBC aggregability is altered during hypertension and if these changes correlate with alterations in RBC membrane protein concentrations. Aggregability changes were evaluated by comparing fibrinogen (Fb)-induced aggregation of RBCs from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with RBCs from age matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats.

The effects of gold-chloroquine derivatives with the formula [Au(PR3)(CQ)]PF6 (where R = Ph (1), Et or Me) on the superoxide anion production by human neutrophils (PMNs, polymorphonuclear cells) were investigated. When these complexes (0.1-3 mumol/l) were added to PMNs prior to the activators formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), they inhibited isoluminol-horseradish peroxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (CLisol). The inhibition was a direct result of effects on PMNs since chemiluminescence in the cell-free system (horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxidase-isoluminol) was not affected. The above mentioned concentrations of the complexes did not show in vitro toxicity on the cells. On the other hand, when 1 mumol/l of complex 1 was added to cells after stimulation, the chemiluminescence of PMNs stimulated by PMA was inhibited, but not the chemiluminescence stimulated by fMLP. The gold-chloroquine binding was essential for the referred activity as chemiluminescence was not influenced by the precursors chloroquine (CAS 54-05-7) and AuCl(PPh3).

Efficient virus and non-virus vector systems for gene transfer to tumor cells have been developed and tested in cell culture and in animal experiments. With some of the earliest and most comprehensively evaluated vectors, such as retroviruses, advanced clinical trials were performed in tumor patients. Malignant primary brain tumors (gliomas) have been chosen for the first clinical studies on novel gene therapy approaches because these tumors are non-metastatic and develop on the largely postmitotic background of normal glial and neuronal tissue. However, the human cancer gene therapy studies performed so far were not as successful as preclinical animal experiments. Furthermore, the clinical studies did not address major limiting factors for in vivo gene therapy, such as insufficient gene transfer rates to the tumor with the used local delivery modalities, and the resulting inability of a particular transgene-prodrug system to confer permanently eradicating cytotoxicity to the whole neoplasm. Critical evaluation of gene transfer and therapy studies has led to the conclusion that, even using identical vectors, the anatomical route of vector administration can dramatically affect both the efficiency of tumor transduction and its spatial distribution, as well as the extent of intratumoral and intracerebral transgene expression. This review concentrates on different physical methods for vector delivery to malignant primary brain tumors in experimental or clinical settings: stereotactic or direct intratumoral injection or convection-enhanced bulk-flow interstitial delivery; intrathecal and intraventricular injection; and intravascular infusion with or without modification of the blood-tumor-barrier.

Nicotine addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that can be difficult to treat. Until recently, pharmacological options for the treatment of tobacco dependence were primarily limited to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) is the first non-nicotine pharmacological treatment approved for smoking cessation. Bupropion SR is recommended for first-line pharmacotherapy alongside NRT in the updated US Clinical Practice Guidelines and the UK Health Education Authority Guidelines. The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommends NRT and bupropion SR for smokers who have expressed a desire to quit smoking. This review presents evidence that bupropion SR is an effective first-line therapy for smoking cessation in a wide range of patient populations. It is associated with significantly higher smoking cessation rates compared with placebo in patients with or without a history of prior bupropion SR or NRT use, and its effect is independent of gender. Bupropion SR treatment is effective in the prevention of relapse to smoking in those patients who have successfully quit, and re-treatment is effective in smokers who recommence smoking after a previous course of bupropion SR. Bupropion SR treatment relieves the symptoms of craving and nicotine withdrawal, and attenuates the weight gain that often occurs after smoking cessation. Data collected from motivational support programmes and employer-based studies provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of bupropion SR as an aid to smoking cessation in 'real life' situations, and confirm the efficacy seen in clinical trials.", "answer": "Bupropion SR is effective in preventing relapse to smoking after successful quitting.", "covered": false}

The purpose of this paper is to present a critique of the current view that reduces cancer to a cellular problem caused by specific gene mutations and to propose, instead, that such a problem might become more intelligible, if it is understood as a phenomenon which results from the breakdown of the morphological plan or Gestalt of the organism. Such an organism, in Aristotelian terms, is characterised for presenting a specific morpho or logos (form) and for having a telos (end) to fulfill. A malignant tumour represents an entity separated from both, the organic logos and the organic telos. According to the basic postulates of Semiophysics--a blend of Aristotelian physics and Catastrophe Theory developed by René Thom--an organism is a source (original) form individuated by a dominant pregnancy which corresponds to its morphogenetic field. Here it is suggested that cancer in aged individuals may result from the progressive exhaustion of the developmental constraints that regulate the process of ontogeny, that is expected to go from the fertilised non-differentiated zygote to the mature fully-developed organism, because there is no further point ahead in the developmental pathway past the reproductive age. Cancer in young individuals (before their reproductive maturity) may then be consequence of premature derangement of such fundamental developmental constraints. In all cases the result is the loss of morphological coherence within the organism. Thus representing a conflict between an organised morphology (the organism) and a part of such a morphology that drifts towards an amorphous state (the tumour).", "answer": "The author critiques the current view by proposing that cancer results from a breakdown of the organism's morphological plan or Gestalt, rather than just specific gene mutations.", "covered": false}

Society increasingly holds schools responsible for the effectiveness of health promotion activities, such as drug abuse prevention efforts funded through the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools program. Consequently, school districts use student surveys as a method for assessing trends and evaluating effects of programs on behavior. Because cost and practical concerns often preclude consistent population-based school survey sampling, risk indicators can provide an essential tool in analyzing needs assessment and program evaluation data. In this paper, three risk measures associated with substance use were selected from among commonly used school surveys. These measures--truancy, grade point average, and recent sexual intercourse--were compared, using meta-analysis techniques, to assess the reliability of risk measures across different survey instruments, different communities, and different points in time. Truancy was judged superior, because of its strong predictive value, particularly among younger students, and because rates can be compared to school records to assess sampling validity over time.", "answer": "School districts use student surveys to assess behavioral trends and evaluate program effectiveness.", "covered": false}

This study evaluated protection against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) afforded by static filter-top caging when automatic watering was used with conventional husbandry techniques as a labor-saving option. We fitted one side of a double-sided 72-cage rack with valves external to each cage; cages on the other side were fitted with shielded internal valves. More than 50% of the mice were breeding mice, and 30% were genetically altered. One cage of mice on each shelf on both sides of the rack was infected with MHV-A59. Each row of cages also contained one standard cage (no filter top) of uninoculated mice at various distances from the infected cage. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after infection of the mice in the test cages, uninoculated mice in 22 cages were tested by serology, and at 8 weeks the uninoculated mice in 54 cages were tested by serology and those in 24 cages were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fecal samples to assess transmission of infection. At 8 weeks post-infection, mice in one uninoculated cage (which had a filter top and an internal valve and was adjacent to a cage of inoculated mice) was seropositive. Examination of feces by PCR revealed MHV shedding in mice in nine uninoculated cages (three lacking filter tops but with internal valve cages; two with filter tops and internal valve cages and adjacent to non-filter top cages; two non-filter-top cages with external valves; and two filter-top cages with external valves, of which one was adjacent to a non-filter-top cage). Routine husbandry using either automatic water valve system prevented (with one exception) transmission among filter-top cages for at least 6 weeks. The 10 cages where transmission occurred were non-filter-top cages (n = 5) and filter-top cages adjacent to non-filter top, infected, or sentinel cages (n = 5). These results suggest that the use of filter top-caging with automatic watering may limit MHV transmission for 6 weeks, during which immunocompetent mice would be expected to clear the virus.

(+/-)-UB-165 (1) is a potent neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligand, which displays functional selectivity between nAChR subtypes. Using UB-165 as a lead structure, two classes of racemic ligands were synthesized and assessed in binding assays for three major nAChR subtypes (alpha4beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha7). The first class of compounds comprises the three pyridine isomers 4-6, corresponding to the 3-, 2-, and 4-substituted pyridine isomers, respectively. Deschloro UB-165 (4) displayed a 2-3-fold decrease in affinity at alpha4beta2 and alpha3beta4 nAChR subtypes, as compared with (+/-)-UB-165, while at the alpha7 subtype a 31-fold increase in affinity was observed. At each of the nAChR subtypes, high affinity binding was dependent on the presence of a 3-substituted pyridine, and the other isomers, 5 and 6, resulted in marked decreases in binding affinities. The second class of compounds is based on replacing the pyridyl unit of 1 with a diazine moiety, giving pyridazine (7), pyrimidine (8), and pyrazine (9), which retain the \"3-pyridyl\" substructure. Modest reductions in binding affinity were observed for all of the diazine ligands at all nAChR subtypes, with the exception of 7, which retained potency comparable to that of 4 in binding to alpha7 nAChR. In functional assays at the alpha3beta4 nAChR, all analogues 4-9 were less potent, as compared with 1, and the rank order of functional potencies correlated with that of binding potencies. Computational studies indicate that the 3-substituted pyridine 4 and 2-substituted pyridine 5, as well as the diazine analogues 7-9, all conform to a distance-based pharmacophore model recently proposed for the alpha4beta2 receptor. However, the nicotinic potencies of these ligands vary considerably and because 5 lacks appreciable nicotinic activity, it is clear that further refinements of this model are necessary in order to describe adequately the structural and electronic demands associated with this nAChR subtype.

Falsely lower digoxin values due to the presence of DLISs have been reported. The association of DLISs with volume expansion led to speculation that they could be natriuretic hormones. Several structures have been proposed for DLISs, including nonesterified fatty acid, phospholipid, lysophospholipid, bile acid, bile salt, and steroid. Exogenous DLISs can be found in serum after ingestion of various Chinese medicines and therapy with spironolactone, canrenone, or potassium canrenoate. Like endogenous DLISs, exogenous DLISs interfere with serum digoxin assays, complicating therapeutic digoxin monitoring. However, most reported endogenous and exogenous DLISs are strongly protein-bound while digoxin is weakly protein-bound. Therefore, interference of both endogenous and exogenous DLISs in serum digoxin measurement can be eliminated by monitoring digoxin concentrations in the protein-free ultrafiltrates.", "answer": "Monitoring digoxin concentrations in the protein-free ultrafiltrates.", "covered": false}

Early-stage Hodgkin's disease accounts for approximately 60% of all cases of the illness. Because of its excellent cure rate (80% to 90%) and high salvage rate, it is difficult to demonstrate survival advantages for different management options. Currently, there is no consensus as to the optimal staging and treatment strategy for early-stage Hodgkin's disease. With the increasing recognition of the late consequences of Hodgkin's disease therapy, the focus of recent clinical trials has been on exploring treatment modifications to reduce these late effects. Areas of controversy that are being explored include extent of staging work-up, radiation field size and dose (and as part of combined-modality therapy), optimal chemotherapy regimen, number of cycles of chemotherapy, and limited- vs extended-field radiation therapy and dose. In addition, several studies are investigating the feasibility of chemotherapy alone in early-stage patients. Along with the evaluation of modified treatments, long-term follow-up efforts should continue in patients who are cured in order to confirm the long-term safety of such therapies.", "answer": "The focus of recent clinical trials in relation to Hodgkin's disease therapy is on exploring treatment modifications to reduce the late effects of therapy.", "covered": false}

The use of low-cost activated carbon derived from bagasse, an agricultural waste material, has been investigated as a replacement for the current expensive methods of removing heavy metals from wastewater. With a view to find a suitable application of the material, activated carbon has been derived, characterized and utilized for the removal of cadmium and zinc. The uptake of cadmium was found to be slightly greater than that of zinc and the sorption capacity increases with increase in temperature. The adsorption studies were carried out both in single- and multi-component systems. Adsorption data on derived carbon follows both the Freundlich and Langmuir models. The data are better fitted by the Freundlich isotherm as compared to Langmuir in both the single- and multi-component systems. Isotherms have been used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters. The kinetics of adsorption depends on the adsorbate concentration and the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent. Studies were conducted to delineate the effect of temperature, initial adsorbate concentration, particle size of the adsorbent and solid-to-liquid ratio. On the basis of these studies, various parameters such as mass transfer coefficient, effective diffusion coefficient, activation energy and entropy of activation were evaluated to establish the mechanisms. It was concluded that the adsorption occurs through a film diffusion mechanism at low as well as at higher concentrations.", "answer": "Cadmium", "covered": false}

Docetaxel (Taxotere) has extended the armamentarium of agents with significant activity in the treatment of ovarian cancer. As a single agent in advanced ovarian cancer patients previously treated with a platinum agent, docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks yields a 30% overall response rate and a 6-month duration of response. In vitro data demonstrate a lack of complete cross-resistance between docetaxel and paclitaxel. As a result, antitumor activity has also been demonstrated in patients refractory to a paclitaxel-containing regimen. In both platinum- and paclitaxel-pretreated patients, the highest response rates were obtained in patients with the longest interval of time since receipt of prior chemotherapy. Docetaxel has been successfully combined with the platinum salts for the first-line treatment of ovarian cancer patients. In combination with cisplatin, response rates of 69% were reported. In an effort to minimize hematologic toxicities and asthenia associated with the cisplatin/docetaxel combination, investigators have substituted carboplatin (Paraplatin) for cisplatin. Several phase II studies and the Scottish Randomized Trial in Ovarian Cancer (SCOTROC), a large phase III randomized trial, of the docetaxel/ carboplatin combination have been completed. The most frequent toxicity noted is neutropenia, which is generally of brief duration, predictable, and manageable. The docetaxel/carboplatin combination has a notably low rate of neurotoxicity.

In this preliminary study, a new approach to ion-exclusion chromatography is proposed to overcome the relatively poor conductivity detection response which occurs in ion-exclusion chromatography when acids are added to the eluent in order to improve peak shape. This approach, termed vacancy ion-exclusion chromatography, requires the sample to be used as eluent and a sample of water to be injected onto a weakly acidic cation-exchange column (TSKgel OApak-A). Vacancy peaks for each of the analytes appear at the retention times of these analytes. Highly sensitive conductivity detection is possible and sharp, well-shaped peaks are produced, leading to efficient separations. Retention times were found to be affected by the concentration of the analytes in the eluent, and also by the presence of an organic modifier such as methanol in the eluent. Detection limits for oxalic, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 microM, respectively, and linear ranges for some acids extended over two orders of magnitude.

Low abdominal hollowing in four-point kneeling is used clinically to test and rehabilitate transversus abdominis (TrA) but many people find this exercise difficult to perform.

Thickness increase in the abdominal muscles during low abdominal hollowing has been measured with real-time ultrasound scanning and may indicate muscle contraction. The present study investigated the effect of instructing PF contraction on TrA thickness increase during low abdominal hollowing. Twelve females and eight males with no reported pelvic floor dysfunction or low back pain in the last two years were taught low abdominal hollowing in four-point kneeling. Subjects performed low abdominal hollowing with and without instruction to contract PF in random order. Transversus abdominis, obliquus internus (OI) and obliquus externus (OE) thickness were measured with ultrasound scanning at rest and during both tests.

Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is characterized by oropharyngeal pain that is triggered by mandibular actions, mainly swallowing, but also chewing, coughing, and yawning.  It is a sporadic condition related to hyperactivity of cranial nerve IX. [5] Glossopharyngeal neuralgia consists of episodic, unilateral sharp pain in the posterior throat, tonsils, base of the tongue, and inferior to the angle of the mandible that can last from seconds to minutes. [5] A subset of patients with glossopharyngeal neuralgia also experienced symptoms of excessive vagal stimulation during attacks, with symptoms such as bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, seizures, or cardiac arrest. [6] This condition is classified as classical glossopharyngeal neuralgia, which is episodic pain, or symptomatic glossopharyngeal neuralgia, in which the pain is constant.

Duodenal atresia is a relatively common intestinal disorder that often presents soon after delivery; hence it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatric surgeon, obstetrician, neonatal nurse, dietitian, pediatrician, intensivist, and geneticist. The definitive management of this condition is surgery, but the procedure is often associated with complications that prolong hospital stay. Over the past three decades, the mortality rates of duodenal atresia have significantly dropped, averaging 2% to 5%. Mortality rates are not directly related to the surgery but to the other associated organ anomalies like complex congenital cardiac defects. However, survival continues to improve with better NICU care, nutritional support, and improved pediatric anesthesia. Today long-term survival of most infants (more than 80%) with duodenal atresia is the norm. The biggest controversy for the future is the use of endoscopy to excise the duodenal web. This technique remains experimental.

Acute coronary syndromes remain the leading cause of mortality in the United States and represent an enormous cost to the health care system. Despite decades of investigation into the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI), the diagnostic process is still quite complex because the majority of patients with chest pain fall in the low or medium risk category with atypical symptoms and nonspecific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Cardiac biochemical markers play an important role in helping physicians make the diagnosis and stratify the risk to patients. However, the ideal cardiac marker and the best diagnostic approach to patients with chest pain in the Emergency Department (ED) remain elusive. Currently, among many cardiac markers, cardiac troponin I seems the most cardiac-specific in the diagnosis of acute MI.

The ciliary muscle consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged longitudinally, circularly, and radially. Controlled by parasympathetics traveling to the orbit in the oculomotor nerve [III], these muscle fibers, on contraction, decrease the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. The ciliary processes are longitudinal ridges projecting from the inner surface of the ciliary body (Fig. 8.110). Extending from them are zonular fibers attached to the lens of the eyeball, which suspend the lens in its proper position and collectively form the suspensory ligament of the lens. Contraction of the ciliary muscle decreases the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. This reduces tension on the suspensory ligament of the lens. The lens therefore becomes more rounded (relaxed) resulting in accommodation of the lens for near vision.

Treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES SCLC) or extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (EPSC) is typically palliative. We set out to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall long-term survival of ES SCLC and EPSC patients, physiologically aged &lt; or = 60 years, responding to first-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose combination alkylating agents with hematologic stem cell support. Patients in first-line chemotherapy response underwent stem cell collection (marrow, peripheral blood progenitor cells, or both) followed by high-dose therapy with 1 of 2 regimens: CBP (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine) or ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) with or without etanidazole. Involved-field radiotherapy was given to selected patients with oligometastatic disease distributed in sites allowing for reasonable radiation ports, and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy was given upon recovery to patients in complete response (CR) or near-CR. A total of 36 patients were treated. Of 29 patients with ES SCLC, 6 (21%) had achieved CR, 18 near-CR, and 5 partial response prior to high-dose therapy. Of 7 patients with EPSC, 3 (43%) had achieved CR, 3 had achieved near-CR, and 1 had progression of disease prior to high-dose therapy. Thirteen ES SCLC patients received high-dose CBP. Of the remaining 23 patients with SCLC or EPSC, 17 were treated with ICE and 6 with ICE plus etanidazole, a hypoxic cell sensitizer. Treatment-related mortality was 11% (4 of 36 patients). For all patients, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 5 months. The 2- and 5-year survivals after intensification were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%-31%) and 9% (95% CI, 3%-27%), respectively. Of the 30 patients in or near CR prior to high-dose therapy, 5 remain continuously progression-free (2 ES SCLC, 3 EPSC) for a median of 55 months (range, 1-96 months) after high-dose therapy. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with more favorable EFS were the use of a more aggressive induction regimen (ICE), and the EPSC histology. These factors were also associated with more favorable overall survival. Other factors associated with more favorable overall survival were the use of short induction therapy (&lt; or = 4 cycles) and younger age (&lt;50 years). Except for high-dose ICE with etanidazole, the use of high-dose systemic therapy in ES SCLC and EPSC was associated with low treatment-related morbidity and mortality over the past 5 years. Late complications were infrequent, and most patients returned to full-time work and activity, barring disease recurrence. Nonetheless, few patients with ES SCLC have progression-free long-term survival. We conclude that high-dose therapy is not indicated as an approach for ES SCLC, except as part of an investigative trial.

Clinically, fascias are extremely important because they often limit the spread of infection and malignant disease. When infections or malignant diseases cross a fascial plain, a primary surgical clearance may require a far more extensive dissection to render the area free of tumor or infection. A typical example of the clinical importance of a fascial layer would be of that covering the psoas muscle.

Adequacy of the reconstructed fields to those originally generated was evaluated by calculating their correlations (r). A priori information on the autocorrelation radius for the field in the direction of a survey (R) allows optimization of survey design and the algorithm of data analysis. A patchy field can be reconstructed properly (r &gt; 0.80) if the distance between transects D &lt; (1.0-1.5)R. If a priori information on the field is not available, the autocorrelation radius should be determined when reconstructing the field, i.e. a posteriori. In cases of field movement, the criterion for choosing a survey direction is based on the relationship between the dimension of moving patches in the direction of movement and that of the surveyed area.

Fluorescence quenching is commonly used to study the extent of metal binding to humic acid or fulvic acid. By studying this phenomenon, the hydrolysis and precipitation behaviors of polymeric and monomeric iron coagulants in the coagulation of humic acid were evaluated. Combined measurements of fluorescence intensity and dissolved organic carbon were performed to distinguish the hydrolysis and organic matter binding of polymeric and monomeric iron salts in coagulating high molecular weight organic compounds. Experimental results showed that ferric chloride had lower fluorescence quenching than polyferric sulfate (PFS), indicating more rapid hydrolysis of the monomeric ferric ion in the coagulation and dilution process. The less fluorescence quenching was caused by the lower residual concentration of Fe-humic acid complexes in the filtrate. There was no clear difference in adsorption ability and fluorescence quenching, which indicated that the physical and chemical properties of Fe(OH)3 flocs formed from PFS and FeCl3 coagulation were similar.

Biodiversity surveys are often hampered by the inability to control extraneous sources of variability introduced into comparisons of populations across a heterogenous landscape. If not specifically accounted for a priori, this noise can weaken comparisons between sites, and can make it difficult to draw inferences about specific ecological processes. We developed a terrain-based, paired-site sampling design to analyze differences in aquatic biodiversity between streams draining eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forests, and those draining mixed hardwood forests in Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (USA). The goal of this design was to minimize variance due to terrain influences on stream communities, while representing the range of hemlock dominated stream environments present in the park. We used geographic information systems (GIS) and cluster analysis to define and partition hemlock dominated streams into terrain types based on topographic variables and stream order. We computed similarity of forest stands within terrain types and used this information to pair hemlock-dominated streams with hardwood counterparts prior to sampling. We evaluated the effectiveness of the design through power analysis and found that power to detect differences in aquatic invertebrate taxa richness was highest when sites were paired and terrain type was included as a factor in the analysis. Precision of the estimated difference in mean richness was nearly doubled using the terrain-based, paired site design in comparison to other evaluated designs. Use of this method allowed us to sample stream communities representative of park-wide forest conditions while effectively controlling for landscape variability.", "answer": "Terrain-based paired-site sampling was used to assess biodiversity losses by pairing hemlock-dominated streams with hardwood counterparts based on similar terrain types, using GIS and cluster analysis, to control for landscape variability and enhance comparison precision.", "covered": false}

In searching for the cause of experimental variations in respiratory research data, serology revealed the prevalence of antibodies against parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV 3) in guinea pigs. The aim of the present study was to explore the transmission rate, course, and kinetics of enzootic PIV 3 infection in guinea pig breeding units. In the first part of the study, blood samples to be analyzed for PIV 3 antibodies were collected from guinea pigs of a PIV 3-positive breeding colony at different times after birth. In the same breeding unit, 6 of 12 2-week-old guinea pigs were relocated and separately housed. The PIV 3 serum antibody titers of the two groups were compared at various times from birth to 13 weeks after birth. In the second part of the study, the spread of infectious virus and virus persistence were explored by housing seronegative sentinel animals together with 2- to 3-week-old guinea pigs from three different PIV 3-positive breeding units. The guinea pigs remaining in the breeding colony as well as those removed and housed separately showed declining serum antibody titers for about 1 month after birth, thereafter the titers were stable until about 8 weeks after birth. Five weeks later, the mean antibody titer of the guinea pigs remaining in the breeding colony had increased to a markedly higher level than that of the relocated, separately housed guinea pigs.

The incidence of gastric cancer and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori are high in Japan, so it is an important issue whether long-term H. pylori infection leads to chronic atrophic gastritis, considered one of the precursors of gastric cancer. We have reported that the grade of atrophy was higher in H. pylori-positive subjects than in H. pylori-negative subjects. It has also been reported that the atrophy of gastric mucosa increased in H. pylori-infected monkeys compared with control monkeys in a 5-year follow-up study. Most H. pylori infections occur in children, and atrophy of the gastric mucosa progresses during aging. Long-term data show that H. pylori infection can lead to gastric atrophy and may play an important role in the development of gastric cancer. Interestingly, there was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori between patients with chronic gastritis and gastric cancer in Japan, but the prevalence of H. pylori in young Japanese gastric cancer patients was significantly higher than in the control group. These data clearly show that H. pylori infection is one of the risk factors of gastric cancer in young Japanese people, There is no answer to whether curing H. pylori infection can reverse the atrophy of the gastric mucosa and decrease the risk of gastric cancer development.

Ocular allergic disorders include seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), which, through immunopathological and molecular immunological techniques, can all be better appreciated as being part of a larger spectrum of an atopic disease state. In SAC, pathological changes, such as increased mast-cell activation, the presence of migratory inflammatory cells, and early signs of cellular activation at the molecular level, are minimal. In PAC, these changes are more pronounced in line with the increased duration of allergenic stimulation. In more chronic forms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as VKC in children and AKC in adults, the following changes are evident: a persistent state of mast cell, eosinophil and lymphocyte activation; noted switching from connective-tissue to mucosal-type mast cells; increased involvement of corneal pathology; and follicular development and fibrosis.

To observe the uptake mechanism of phenol, bacteria were isolated from a petroleum refinery effluent and identified. Study was carried out to understand the effect of varying sub-lethal concentrations of phenol, on all the isolated individual bacterial cultures. Out of the bacteria isolated, Serratia liquefaciens was found to tolerate phenol concentration up to 1500 mg l(-1). A microbial consortium of the isolated bacteria was formulated and immobilized. Individual cultures were also immobilized and uptake of phenol by the immobilized micro-organisms was observed in a nutrient-rich and nutrient-stressed medium containing phenol as a sole source of carbon. A time-dependent uptake of phenol was exhibited by the micro-organisms in nutrient-stressed medium, after which a sudden increase in phenol concentration occurred in the extracellular medium, till it reached back to the initial concentration.

Parameters from single-component isotherm models were used in multicomponent isotherm models to predict the aqueous phase sorption of trichloroethylene (TCE) in the presence of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in four zeolites, Tenax, and three natural solids. The Langmuir, the Polanyi-Dubinin, and the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models were used to simulate single-component sorption in zeolites. The Langmuir two-site, the Polanyi-Dubinin two-site, and the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models were used to simulate single-component sorption in Tenax and natural solids. Two-site models have been used previously to model sorption in soils and sediments, and they combine an adsorption component (e.g., Langmuir) with a linear partitioning component. By using parameters from the different single-component isotherm models, the multicomponent Langmuir, the ideal adsorbed solution theory, and the Polanyi theory were each used to predict multicomponent sorption. In general, the ability to predict TCE sorption in the presence of PCE depended more on the choice of the single-component model than the multicomponent model, and better results were obtained when the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm was used for single-component sorption. This suggests that the more mechanistically based Langmuir and Polanyi-type models may not adequately describe the distribution of adsorption sites in some model and natural solids.

Here, we propose a well-ordered and nonexperimental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach for the determination of irrelevant drug plasma (IPC) and urine concentrations (IUC). The published plasma clearance is used to transform an effective (marketed) dose into an effective concentration (EPC). EPC is transformed into an IPC by applying a safety factor (SF). This method is based on several assumptions (eg, drug effects reversibly driven by plasma concentration, linearity of drug disposition). The suitability of the computed IPC and IUC can be checked by calculating the residual amount of drug at IPC and computing a minimal drug withdrawal time.

Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA, is thought to be necessary for cellular immortality and carcinogenesis. Telomerase activity is associated with the majority of malignant human cancers. The mRNA that encodes the telomerase catalytic subunit (human telomerase repeat transcriptase; hTERT) has recently been identified, and the expression of the hTERT gene is thought to regulate the activation of telomerase. However, the expression of hTERT mRNA in esophageal tissues has not been reported. We investigated hTERT gene expression in cancerous and noncancerous esophageal tissues, and determined the relationship between hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity. Tissues from esophageal carcinomas in 14 patients, reflux esophagitis in 12 patients, esophageal acanthosis in 2 patients, esophageal papilloma in 1 patient, radiation esophagitis in 1 patient, and normal esophageal epithelium in 11 patients (including 3 specimens of normal epithelium from patients with esophageal carcinoma) were examined. All specimens were taken endoscopically. hTERT gene expression was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Quantitative analysis of telomerase activity was analyzed by fluorescence telomeric repeat amplification protocol (F-TRAP) assay. Thirteen of the 14 (93%) esophageal carcinoma specimens expressed hTERT mRNA and revealed detectable telomerase activity. Noncancerous esophageal lesions had not only hTERT mRNA expression with a high frequency (14 of 16 cases; 88%) but also detectable telomerase activity (12 of 13 cases; 92%). Normal esophageal epithelium also highly expressed hTERT mRNA (10 of 11 cases; 91%) and revealed detectable telomerase activity (all 9 cases; 100%). In 32 of the 35 specimens analyzed for both hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity (91%), the expression of hTERT mRNA was consistent with detectable telomerase activity. The expression of hTERT mRNA was detected not only in cancerous but also in noncancerous esophageal tissues at a high frequency. This result was different from that reported for other gastrointestinal epithelium. Moreover, telomerase activity in esophageal carcinoma was significantly stronger than that in reflux esophagitis and normal epithelium. In addition, there was a strong relation ship between the detection of telomerase activity and the expression of hTERT mRNA in cancerous and noncancerous esophageal tissues. Thus, the qualitative analysis of hTERT mRNA expression may not be useful as a biomarker of carcinoma in esophageal tissues.

Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements.

None of the established treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignant glioma has improved its very poor prognosis. Adjuvant locoregional radio-immunotherapy (RIT) represents a new therapeutic approach. We present our initial experience with this therapeutic tool with respect to adverse effects, biokinetics and clinical follow-up. Following surgery and radiotherapy, 12 patients with glioma (4, WHO stage III; 8, WHO stage IV) underwent 1-5 RIT-cycles (average dose 1100 MBq 131labelled monoclonal BC-4 antibodies) at six week intervals. Follow-up included serial FDG-PET and MRI investigations. Evaluation of biokinetics included whole body scans, together with analysis of blood, urine and fluid from the tumor cavity. Following RIT, four patients experienced temporary seizures, which, in one case, were associated with temporary aphasia. Eight patients developed HAMA (human anti-mouse antibodies) during follow-up. Mean biologic half-life of the radiopharmaceutical in the resection cavity was 3.9 d (range: 1.0-10.2 d) and remained stable intraindividually during further RIT-cycles. The antibody/radionuclide conjugate remained stable in the tumor cavity for at least 5 d. Median survival presently stands at 18.5 months compared to 9.7 months in a historical patient group (n = 89) undergoing conventional therapeutic strategies. Five patients show no signs of recurrence. In three patients with post-surgical evidence of residual tumor, one patient showed partial remission, one stable disease, and one progressive disease during RIT. Four patients without evidence of residual tumor mass at the beginning of RIT developed recurrence during therapy.

Airway preparations exhibited a spontaneous narrowing (mean+/-SEM -33+/-5% of the luminal area). Removal of the bronchial epithelium almost completely prevented the development of spontaneuous narrowing (-6+/-3%; p&lt;0.001). The addition of platelet-activating factor stimulated human eosinophils to the bronchial sections led to significant narrowing of the airway lumen (-39+/-9%; p&lt;0.05).

Analyses techniques used in those studies required sample retrieval from solution, which may alter the sample surface. In this work FTIR/ ATR was used in analysis, enabling in situ study of the transformation within the aqueous environment. To test the biocompatibility of this brushite, cellular response to the transformation needs to be understood. Cellular response was initiated by bovine serum albumin adsorption on the brushite surface. The response was studied by monitoring the conformation of the adsorbed protein, which is critical to cellular reaction. This required monitoring the brushite transformation and surface adsorbed protein conformation simultaneously which can be realized using FTIR/ATR.

The chances of integration between an implant and the surrounding bone tissue depend on the surface characteristics of the implant itself. Particularly, chemical composition and surface roughness of the material have emerged as crucial factors in affecting the behaviour of cells in contact with the material. Among various surfaces, calcium phosphate coatings seem to favour a rapid initial integration, but their dissolution by extracellular fluids raises some concern about the long-term stability at the bone-implant interface. Fluorinated apatites are known to be more stable than other ceramic coatings, but, at present, little is known on their effects on human cells. In this study, MG63 osteoblast-like cells were seeded onto two fluorohydroxyapatite (FHA)-coated titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) materials differing in roughness, respectively, LR-FHA (Ra = 5.6 microm) and HR-FHA (Ra = 21.2 microm). Quantification of the cells in contact with the FHA-coated materials by conventional methods involved some technical difficulties, on which we report. Only the indirect esteem by the measure of total content of proteins and a procedure based on cell count, following a double enzymatic treatment to detach the cells, offered plain results, indicating no significant differences between cellular growth in contact with test materials and with plastic control. Differentiation and functionality of the cells were comparatively evaluated by analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_635_1", "question": "How is vitamin A recommended for chemoprevention of bladder cancer, and why should high doses of beta-carotene be avoided?", "doc_chunk": "Chemoprevention of bladder cancer. The data presented herein, although highly supportive for a protective role of various nutrients against bladder cancer, are far from definitive. Many authorities question the validity of current recommendations for nutritional chemoprevention against bladder cancer. The reason for the wide variations reported in epidemiologic studies lies in the nature of observational studies. Dietary studies are limited in their conclusions because the protection afforded by the consumption of a particular nutrient may be multifactorial, with different components of the food exerting potential chemopreventive effects. Furthermore, measuring levels of nutrients in the food intake of populations is confounded by factors that might affect these levels and also the incidence of cancer. For example, vitamin A can come from animal or vegetarian sources. Because animal fat has been identified as a potential carcinogen in man, depending on the source of the vitamin, varying levels of protection might be deduced. In addition, chemoprevention studies using dietary supplements are expected to have mild effects, and large studies would be required to confirm statistical significance. Even with agents such as intravesical chemotherapy, only half the studies achieve statistical significance [29]. Prospective randomized trials with a large sample size, longer follow-up, and an extended duration of treatment are needed to clarify the association between micronutrients and cancer protection. With these caveats in mind, several recommendations can be made. Simple measures, such as drinking more fluids (especially water), can have a profound impact on the incidence of bladder cancer. Vitamins are being extensively studied in chemopreventive trials for different cancers. There is strong evidence for a chemoprotective effect of vitamin A in bladder cancer. The authors recommend 32,000 IU/day of vitamin A initially, with lower doses (24,000 IU) for persons less than 50 kg. Because liver toxicity is a possibility with long-term administration, the dose should be decreased to 16,000 IU after 3 years. High doses of beta-carotene should be avoided based on a large clinical trial reporting a 25% increase in the number of cases of prostate cancer and a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer. Vitamin B6 has been studied in several clinical trials in bladder cancer. The US-based Veterans Administration cooperative study found benefit for vitamin B6 when given as a single agent. Data for vitamins C and E are insufficient to recommend either agent as stand-alone treatment. Nonetheless, each of these vitamins is known to have beneficial effects, including improved function of the immune system. It is possible that only a small percentage of patients with bladder cancer respond to vitamins B6, C, or E, yet each is safe, nontoxic, and inexpensive. In an effort to pool the efficacy of individual agents and to increase the power of study, the authors evaluated the combination of vitamins A, B6, C, and E in a double-blind trial. The observed 50% 5-year reduction in tumor recurrence was highly significant and greater than would be expected for any of the individual ingredients and suggests that combinations of nutritional agents may be most appropriate. A large-volume study along similar lines is being conducted. Among the numerous other compounds and dietary substances purported to have chemopreventive effect, soybeans, garlic, and green tea stand out as having the greatest promise and can freely be recommended to patients. For synthetically synthesized agents such as celecoxib, piroxicam, or DFMO, recommendations must be deferred until the results of clinical trials are conclusively in favor of their use. Many of the dietary factors found to be protective against bladder cancer are being investigated in other cancers and are beneficial to general health. Although naturally occurring nutrients are ideal, especially because the delicate balance of various micronutrients might be impossible to synthesize in the laboratory, the general population finds it easier to take vitamin supplements. Unfortunately, dietary changes such as decreasing fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake are more difficult to initiate. There is a mistaken notion that simply because an agent is naturally occurring, it cannot be as beneficial as taking a substance synthesized in the laboratory. Even in a high-risk group such as nuclear-bomb survivors in Japan, high consumption of vegetables and fruit is protective against bladder cancer [44]. Encouraging patients to follow an essentially healthy food habit lifestyle will be a significant contribution in the fight against cancer.", "answer": "Vitamin A is recommended at 32,000 IU/day initially, reduced based on weight and duration due to liver toxicity risks.

In the absence of identifiable inflammatory, infectious, or pathologic processes, it generally was assumed that these events had no bearing on the baboon's future ability to return to cyclicity and conceive. However, these assumptions were based on observational and anecdotal evidence. To test the validity of these assumptions, we established two data groups: baboons that had uncomplicated stillbirths (Gp-1; n = 11) and those that had uncomplicated miscarriages (Gp-2; n = 12). The mean number of days from first detectable postpartum estrus (i.e., perineal swelling/turgescence) to conception was 49 days for Gp-1 and 53 days for Gp-2. In addition, for Gp-1 animals we determined that the mean number of days to the first indication of estrus was 29 days; these data were unavailable for Gp-2 because of the lack of parturition as a reference point. Control baboons (lactating mothers) required approximately 59 days from first detectable estrus to conception, and our findings for Gp-1 and Gp-2 were consistent with this value.

Docetaxel has been evaluated as single-agent therapy, sequentially as a single agent following anthracycline-containing regimens, and in combination with anthracyclines, cisplatin, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with high-risk early breast cancer. Two large, randomized phase III trials have demonstrated significant improvements in clinical and pathologic response rates with the sequential addition of docetaxel to an anthracycline-containing preoperative regimen. A trial conducted in the United Kingdom demonstrated that docetaxel sequential to CVAP (cyclophosphamide [Cytoxan, Neosar], vincristine, doxorubicin [Adriamycin], prednisolone) produced a higher overall clinical response rate (94% vs 66%, P = .001) and pathologic complete response rate (34% vs 18%) compared to additional cycles of CVAP as primary chemotherapy.

In this work we suppose the appearance of Ca++ spiral waves in the vegetal pole of ascidian egg cells after the first ooplasmic segregation. Previously we observed that (Ballarò and Reas [2000a]), when the myoplasm is completely localized in the vegetal region (excitable stage) and the ascidian egg cell is perturbed by an increase of Ca++ concentration in the culture medium, the cell reacts by showing persistent mechanical waves of contraction which exist as long as the cell is perturbed. Experimentally we observed the production of a polar lobe located in the vegetal region and the change of the inclination of mitotic furrow, after the appearance of a myoplasmic spiral wave in the vegetal pole.

Mechanisms and relevance of idiosyncratic drug reactions. In adverse drug reactions, effects accounted for by the pharmacological profile of the drug may be distinguished from sometimes bizarre, unpredictable events (\"idiosyncrasies\"). In the majority of cases, the latter are due to reactive intermediates formed by members of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These products are usually formed at very low quantities. However, genetic disposition (e.g. by enhanced expression of the catalyzing enzyme or failure of protective factors such as glutathione) or certain external conditions (for example comedication of inducers of drug metabolism) may lead to toxic intermediates being available at relevant quantities. Once generated, these metabolites will react with macromolecules and finally cause cell necrosis. Necrosis may result from direct damage to functions essential to the cell or be secondary to harmful immune reactions activated by recognition of the new structures as neoantigens. As the principal site of drug metabolism, the liver is most frequently affected by idiosyncratic reactions, which often enough are recognized only after large numbers of patients have been treated. The idiosyncratic potential of a drug relates to its chemical structure rather than its pharmacological mechanism. Risks are evident if biotransformation yields products with chemical substructures such as quinones, phenoles, acyl halides, aromatic and hydroxyl amines. There are numerous cases of precursor drugs with idiosyncratic potential that have been replaced or marginalized by agents with more favorable chemical properties. Examples include beta 1-preferential beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (toxic precursor: practolol) and the choline esterase inhibitors used in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the latter group, tacrine (CAS 321-64-2) gives rise to high liver enzyme levels in about 30% of the patients, an effect not shared with more recent, chemically different entities. A similar case can be made for the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (CAS 97322-87-7) (marketed, now withdrawn in the USA) and its successors rosiglitazone (CAS 122320-73-4) and pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8). Due to its different chemical structure, only troglitazone can be transformed into a reactive quinone metabolite, a process that may be accelerated by the drug inducing its own metabolism. In agreement with this view, there is no evidence of specific hepatic toxicity with the two successor drugs. Ongoing progress in molecular toxicology may aid in minimizing idiosyncratic hazards already at early stages of drug development.", "answer": "The chemical structure of a drug relates to its idiosyncratic potential for causing adverse reactions because certain structural features can lead to the formation of toxic metabolites during biotransformation.", "covered": false}

In accidental wounds, trauma and infection can result in dehiscence of primarily closed wounds and in sequestrum formation when cortical bone is exposed. In experimental studies, it has been shown that second intention healing is faster and occurs with less complications in ponies than in horses. Also, a greater initial inflammatory response was seen in ponies. Based on these experimental data, it was hypothesised that accidental wounds in ponies would heal with a lower incidence of wound dehiscence and/or sequestrum formation compared to horses. A retrospective study of 89 ponies and 422 horses with traumatic wounds was performed. The animals, wounds and treatments were categorised and related to the success rate of primary closure and to the incidence of sequestrum formation. The ponies and horses were of similar age and sex. The wounds that were treated were comparable for localisation, duration, degree of contamination and depth in both groups of animals, but there were significantly more cases with ruptured extensor tendons in ponies. Antibiotics and NSAIDs were administered significantly less often to ponies. The success rate of primary closure was significantly higher in ponies than in horses, and sequestra were formed significantly less often in ponies. It was concluded that the results of healing were better in ponies although the external conditions were less favourable. This may be associated with the differences in the initial inflammatory response after injury as found in earlier experimental work, which may result in a better local defence against wound infection.", "answer": "Sequestrum formation was significantly less frequent in ponies compared to horses.", "covered": false}
{"id": "pubmed23n0400_652_0", "question": "How does the intake of tomatoes and tomato products potentially affect the risk of prostate cancer?", "doc_chunk": "Tomato products, lycopene, and prostate cancer risk. Several case-control and large prospective studies focusing on dietary assessment suggest that the intake of tomatoes and tomato products may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer [18]. Although less certain at present, the accumulated data suggest that the benefit may be most pronounced in the protection against more advanced or aggressive prostate cancer. It is possible that lycopene is one of the compounds in raw and processed tomato products that may contribute to a lower risk of prostate cancer; however, this hypothesis remains to be further investigated. Other carotenoids and phytochemicals in tomato products may also contribute to the proposed health benefits. Food processing does not seem to reduce the benefits but may, in fact, enhance the bioavailability of beneficial components. The reported correlations or associations between the consumption of tomato products and prostate cancer risk should not be interpreted as causal until additional data are available from a variety of studies in different populations. Ideally, randomized controlled intervention studies would provide an ultimate test of the tomato/lycopene hypothesis; however, the expense, long duration of exposure, and the near universal consumption of tomato products among Americans make a dietary intervention study difficult to undertake. It is reasonable to recommend to the general population the consumption of tomato products at approximately one serving per day or five servings per week as part of an overall healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risks of prostate cancer, other malignancies, or other chronic diseases. This recommendation is consistent with current dietary guidelines to increase fruit and vegetable consumption to lower the risk of heart disease and many types of cancer [38]. Nutritional prevention of prostate cancer is very different from the use of dietary or nutritional treatments for established prostate cancer. The use of lycopene and other extracts for the treatment of prostate cancer is a separate issue that warrants individual attention and investigation.", "answer": "The intake of tomatoes and tomato products potentially lowers the risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced or aggressive forms.", "covered": false}

The action of p53 as a tumor suppressor involves inhibition of cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Loss of p53 function therefore allows the uncontrolled proliferation associated with cancerous cells. While design of most anti-cancer agents has focused on targeting and inactivating cancer promoting targets, such as oncogenes, recent attention has been given to restoring the lost activity of tumor suppressor genes. Because the loss of p53 function is so prevalent in human cancer, this protein is an ideal candidate for such therapy. Several gene therapeutic strategies have been employed in the attempt to restore p53 function to cancerous cells. These approaches include introduction of wild-type p53 into cells with mutant p53; the use of small molecules to stabilize mutant p53 in a wild-type, active conformation; and the introduction of agents to prevent degradation of p53 by proteins that normally target it. In addition, because mutant p53 has oncogenic gain of function activity, several approaches have been investigated to selectively target and kill cells harboring mutant p53. These include the introduction of mutant viruses that cause cell death only in cells with mutant p53 and the introduction of a gene that, in the absence of functional p53, produces a toxic product. Many obstacles remain to optimize these strategies for use in humans, but, despite these, restoration of p53 function is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic approach.", "answer": "The function of p53 as a tumor suppressor gene is to inhibit cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.", "covered": false}

The ackee fruit contains both hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B. Hypoglycin A is the toxin primarily responsible for causing Jamaican vomiting sickness. The exact mechanism of hypoglycin A is not known; however, hypoglycemia most likely results from the inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Metabolism of hypoglycin also produces a toxic byproduct, methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid (MCPA-CoA) which inhibits long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation, resulting in glycogen store depletion. It is impossible to predict what patients will develop symptoms following ingestion as the minimum toxic dose is not currently known. Hypoglycin may be hepatoxic, with liver pathology resembling a Reyes Syndrome-like pattern. Chronic ackee fruit ingestion has been reported to cause cholestatic jaundice among adults.

Chronic inflammation, the associated cardiovascular disease, and attendant high mortality remain huge problems in the HD population. Determining the predominant causal factors in the triggering and maintenance of this inflammatory state is of paramount importance in formulating treatment strategies for individuals and for centers. In most cases, causation is multifactorial and several different areas of the HD process need to be considered. In this respect, the water system in HD centers is certainly one parameter that demands careful design, rigorous monitoring and strict adherence to effective disinfection protocols. In this way it may be possible not only to reduce levels of inflammatory markers, but to improve performance in other clinical areas, such as EPO therapy, and perhaps outcomes in the HD population.", "answer": "Improving water quality in hemodialysis centers can reduce inflammatory markers and potentially enhance other clinical outcomes.", "covered": false}

Although intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is very effective in the treatment of and prophylaxis against superficial bladder cancer, its exact mechanism of action is not clear. In this study, the effect of BCG on telomerase activity was examined in the T24 and J82 bladder cancer cell lines, the ACHN human renal cell carcinoma cell line, and the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. T24 and J82 cells were cocultured with BCG for 5 days. Telomerase activity was measured by telomeric repeat amplification protocol. Cell-cycle phase was determined by FACS analysis. Telomerase activity in all cell lines provided high absorbance. Telomerase activity in BCG-treated T24 and J82 cells was significantly decreased when compared with that in the nontreated cells. On the other hand, telomerase activity did not change in ACHN and PC-3 cells after they had been cocultured with BCG. In BCG-treated T24 cells and J82 cells, apoptotic cells were markedly increased compared with those in the nontreated cells. These results suggest that the reduction of telomerase activity is related to the mechanism of BCG effects.

The purpose of this paper is to present a critique of the current view that reduces cancer to a cellular problem caused by specific gene mutations and to propose, instead, that such a problem might become more intelligible, if it is understood as a phenomenon which results from the breakdown of the morphological plan or Gestalt of the organism. Such an organism, in Aristotelian terms, is characterised for presenting a specific morpho or logos (form) and for having a telos (end) to fulfill. A malignant tumour represents an entity separated from both, the organic logos and the organic telos. According to the basic postulates of Semiophysics--a blend of Aristotelian physics and Catastrophe Theory developed by René Thom--an organism is a source (original) form individuated by a dominant pregnancy which corresponds to its morphogenetic field. Here it is suggested that cancer in aged individuals may result from the progressive exhaustion of the developmental constraints that regulate the process of ontogeny, that is expected to go from the fertilised non-differentiated zygote to the mature fully-developed organism, because there is no further point ahead in the developmental pathway past the reproductive age. Cancer in young individuals (before their reproductive maturity) may then be consequence of premature derangement of such fundamental developmental constraints. In all cases the result is the loss of morphological coherence within the organism. Thus representing a conflict between an organised morphology (the organism) and a part of such a morphology that drifts towards an amorphous state (the tumour).", "answer": "The breakdown of the morphological plan contributes to cancer development by causing a loss of morphological coherence, leading to uncontrolled cellular growth.", "covered": false}

Update on disease assessment. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a multisystem immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation of exocrine glands leading to clinical symptoms of dryness, particularly of the eyes and mouth which can be severe and disabling. It can occur in association with other rheumatic disorders or as a primary entity (PSS), often associated with B-cell hyperreactivity manifested by hypergammaglobulinaemia and anti-Ro and/or anti-La autoantibodies. These patients are more likely to have systemic involvement, for example of the pulmonary, neurological or haematological systems, and have a 44 times increased risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, this being the major adverse outcome in this disorder. Clinical trials of new therapies in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been advanced by the development of internationally agreed assessment and outcome measures such as the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR core datasets of disease activity in RA and measures of activity and damage in SLE such as BILAG, SLEDAI, SLICC etc. No such equivalent consensus exists for SS and as a result clinical trials have all used different, unvalidated, ad hoc measures of disease assessment and outcome. One attempt to bring a coherent approach to this issue is the \"Copenhagen model\" or disease assessment wheel that places each disease manifestation within specific categories depending on their presumed pathogenesis. Attempts have also been made to develop this into a severity tool by grading specific manifestations according to severity. In March 2000, interested specialists from around Europe met to develop a consensus on the broad principles underpinning disease assessment in SS (particularly PSS). It was agreed to adopt the international approach of dividing assessment into: exocrine and-nonexocrine disease activity (potentially reversible and including sicca symptoms and objective measures and systemic symptoms (particularly fatigue) and clinical features), damage (present for over 6 months), health-related and generic quality of life, and standard approaches to adverse events/toxicity and health economic aspects. The workshop also began the process of developing specific measures of sicca symptoms and systemic activity and damage.

The threshold of change model (TCM) is a statistical technique for analyzing ordered stages of change variables. TCM focuses on the thresholds that separate the ordered stages, and the effects of explanatory variables are evaluated in terms of raising or lowering the thresholds. TCM also allows the explanatory variables to exert differential influence on each threshold. In this paper, we use TCM to analyze the data from a clinical trial that compared assertive community treatment (ACT) with standard case management (SCM) for patients with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder. Endpoint data (36-month follow up) were used for this analysis. The response variable is the recoded Substance Abuse Treatment Scale with three ordered levels (engagement/persuasion, active treatment, and recovery/relapse prevention), and hence two thresholds. The explanatory variables are gender and group (ACT vs. SCM). The results indicate that gender exerts constant and significant effects on both thresholds.

In the TAX 317 trial, 204 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (49 received 100 mg/m2 and 55 received 75 mg/m2) or best supportive care (100 patients). Median survival was 7.5 months with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75) vs 4.6 months for best supportive care (P = .010); and 1-year survival was 37% for D75 vs 11% for best supportive care (P = .010). Quality-of-life analysis also showed statistically significant improvement in disease-related symptoms with docetaxel vs best supportive care. In the TAX 320 study, 373 patients were randomized to receive docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 (D100), docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (D75), or a control arm of either vinorelbine (Navelbine) or ifosfamide (Ifex) (V/I).

In phase II evaluation of weekly irinotecan plus cisplatin, response rates have exceeded 30% in esophageal and gastric cancers. Irinotecan is an active radiosensitizer in preclinical studies and clinical trials in lung cancer. We performed a phase I trial of weekly irinotecan, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer. Induction chemotherapy with irinotecan and cisplatin was given prior to radiotherapy, over 6 weeks, cycled on a 2-week-on, 1-week-off schedule to relieve dysphagia. Radiotherapy was given subsequently in 180-cGy daily fractions to a total dose of 5,040 cGy.

Among 18 patients entered in the trial, minimal toxicity has been observed, with no grade 3/4 esophagitis or diarrhea. Hematologic toxicity has been minimal. Dose-limiting toxicity (ie, requiring more than a 2-week delay in radiotherapy) has been seen in one of three patients at the 80-mg/M2 irinotecan dose level, and accrual continues at this dose level. Among 13 evaluable patients, five complete responses have been seen (38%), including three pathologic complete responses in 10 patients undergoing surgery (30%). Asymptomatic pulmonary emboli were noted on the posttreatment computed tomography scan in 3 of 15 patients, prompting the addition of warfarin sodium (Coumadin) prophylaxis on protocol.

Indications for H. pylori eradication therapy were classified into three groups: (A) recommended: gastric and duodenal ulcers; (B) recommended and managed at a specialized institution: low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; (C) current studies of the significance of the therapy: following endoscopic mucosal resection of early gastric cancer and gastric surgery for gastric cancers, hyperplastic gastric polyp, atrophic gastritis, and nonulcer dyspepsia. The first-line therapy regimen recommended is 1 week of triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor standard dose twice a day, amoxicillin 750 mg bid, and clarithromycin 200 or 400 mg bid. The reasons for preferring this regimen are to avoid extensive use of metronidazole, which is allowed for treatment of Trichomonas infection in Japan, and the low rate of emergence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori with amoxicillin co-therapy. For second-line therapy patients should be referred to specialists, who can examine the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates against antibiotics and have much experience with this therapy.", "answer": "Triple therapy is preferred as the first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection in Japan to avoid extensive use of metronidazole, which is restricted to treating Trichomonas infection, and due to the low rate of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori emergence when used with amoxicillin.", "covered": false}

In the clinic A Morton’s neuroma is an enlarged common plantar nerve, usually in the third interspace between the third and fourth toes. In this region of the foot the lateral plantar nerve often unites with the medial plantar nerve. As the two nerves join, the resulting nerve is typically larger in diameter than those of the other toes. Also, it is in a relatively subcutaneous position, just above the fat pad of the foot close to the artery and the vein. Above the nerve is the deep transverse metatarsal ligament, which is a broad strong structure holding the metatarsals together. Typically, as the patient enters the “push-off” phase of walking the interdigital nerve is sandwiched between the ground and the deep transverse metatarsal ligament.

The 4-aryl-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-2-butenoic acids and their isosteric tetrazoles are among an emerging class of aryl beta-diketo (ADK)-based agents which exhibit potent inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN)-catalyzed strand transfer (ST) processes, while having much reduced potencies against 3'-processing (3'-P) reactions. In the current study, L-708,906 (10e) and 5CITEP (13b), which are two examples of ADK inhibitors that have been reported by Merck and Shionogi pharmaceutical companies, served as model ADK leads. Structural variations to both the \"left\" and \"right\" sides of these molecules were made in order to examine effects on HIV-1 integrase inhibitory potencies. It was found that a variety of groups could be introduced onto the left side aryl ring with maintenance of good ST inhibitory potency. However, introduction of carboxylic acid-containing substituents onto the left side aryl ring enhanced 3'-P inhibitory potency and reduced selectivity toward ST reactions. Although both L-708,906 and 5CITEP show potent inhibition of IN in biochemical assays, there is a disparity of antiviral activity in cellular assays using HIV-1-infected cells. Neither 5CITEP nor any other of the indolyl-containing inhibitors exhibit significant antiviral effects in cellular systems.

Lead concentrations in tree rings of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sampled at a parkland in north-west England were measured in wood formed since the mid-1800s. Concentrations of Pb in Scots pine and oak peaked in wood formed between 1900 and 1940, most likely because of Pb accumulation in heartwood, indicating that oak and Scots pine are unsuitable for monitoring temporal changes in Pb deposition at the study site. In contrast, Pb concentrations in sycamore, a species that has similar heartwood and sapwood chemistry, were relatively constant in wood formed between the mid-1800s and 1950. Lead concentrations decreased steadily in sycamore tree rings formed after the 1950s, and decreased more abruptly in wood formed after 1985. This sharp decrease in wood Pb cannot be due to decreases in soil Pb concentration. Stable Pb isotope analysis was used to further investigate Pb patterns in sycamore wood. Excess 206Pb/207Pb ratios in tree-rings of sycamore were relatively constant, approximately 1.17, in wood formed prior to the 1930s, but decreased steadily thereafter reaching a minimum value of approximately 1.16 in wood formed between 1975 and 1985 after which time 206Pb/207Pb ratios increased. This pattern is consistent with changes in Pb isotope ratios measured in peat, sediment and aerosol samples in the UK. However, the magnitude of the decrease in 206Pb/207Pb (largely due to gasoline Pb) is considerably lower than in other studies and our estimates indicate that less than 20% of the total Pb in sycamore wood measured since the mid-1800s is derived from gasoline emissions. A more likely explanation for the pattern of Pb observed in sycamore tree rings is that soil Pb accumulates within rings of the diffuse porous wood over a number of years. Such uptake patterns would result in lower Pb concentrations in the outer (more recently formed) tree rings, which coincide with recent reductions in Pb deposition in the UK. Overall, this study indicates that tree ring chemistry is unsuitable for monitoring historical changes in Pb deposition at the study site.", "answer": "Stable Pb isotope analysis helped clarify the sources and historical deposition patterns of lead in sycamore wood, indicating that less than 20% of the lead derived from gasoline emissions, with changes in 206Pb/207Pb ratios reflecting broader environmental lead deposition trends.", "covered": false}

This study evaluated protection against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) afforded by static filter-top caging when automatic watering was used with conventional husbandry techniques as a labor-saving option. We fitted one side of a double-sided 72-cage rack with valves external to each cage; cages on the other side were fitted with shielded internal valves. More than 50% of the mice were breeding mice, and 30% were genetically altered. One cage of mice on each shelf on both sides of the rack was infected with MHV-A59. Each row of cages also contained one standard cage (no filter top) of uninoculated mice at various distances from the infected cage. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after infection of the mice in the test cages, uninoculated mice in 22 cages were tested by serology, and at 8 weeks the uninoculated mice in 54 cages were tested by serology and those in 24 cages were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fecal samples to assess transmission of infection. At 8 weeks post-infection, mice in one uninoculated cage (which had a filter top and an internal valve and was adjacent to a cage of inoculated mice) was seropositive. Examination of feces by PCR revealed MHV shedding in mice in nine uninoculated cages (three lacking filter tops but with internal valve cages; two with filter tops and internal valve cages and adjacent to non-filter top cages; two non-filter-top cages with external valves; and two filter-top cages with external valves, of which one was adjacent to a non-filter-top cage). Routine husbandry using either automatic water valve system prevented (with one exception) transmission among filter-top cages for at least 6 weeks. The 10 cages where transmission occurred were non-filter-top cages (n = 5) and filter-top cages adjacent to non-filter top, infected, or sentinel cages (n = 5). These results suggest that the use of filter top-caging with automatic watering may limit MHV transmission for 6 weeks, during which immunocompetent mice would be expected to clear the virus. Our findings also suggest that long-term use of automatic watering in static filter-top cages handled using conventional husbandry techniques may not prevent transmission in the vicinity of high virus concentrations or open caging.", "answer": "9", "covered": false}

A population of the nonmigratory estuarine fish species Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog) indigenous to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated Superfund site (New Bedford Harbor, MA, USA) demonstrated an inherited tolerance to local, dioxinlike contaminants (DLCs). These findings suggest that DLCs have acted as selective agents, allowing the survival of only the most tolerant individuals, forming DLC-adapted populations. We hypothesized that DLC-tolerant mummichog populations would reside where local conditions are toxic to sensitive individuals, and that toxic environmental conditions could be predicted based on responses of sensitive early life stages to laboratory exposures of DLCs. As a measure of DLC tolerance, progeny of field-collected fish were tested in the laboratory with a dioxinlike PCB congener, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). Mummichog populations were collected from sites with sediment PCB concentrations predicted to range from nontoxic to toxic. Consistent with predictions, tolerant populations were indigenous to sites with elevated sediment PCB concentrations. Also, as predicted, DLC-tolerant populations were resident to sites far less contaminated than the Superfund site.

STAT1 and, under some circums-tances. STAT3 are important for transducing pro-apoptotic signals whereas STAT3 and STAT5 have been implicated in promoting cell survival. Recent studies demonstrate that regulation of apoptotic pathways by STATs is largely due to transcriptional activation of genes that encode proteins that mediate or trigger the cell death process, such as Bcl-xL, caspases, Fas and TRAIL as well as those that regulate cell cycle progression, such as p21waf1. Interestingly, STAT proteins may also regulate apoptosis through a non-transcriptional mechanism by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein NF-kappaB.

In this paper, the characteristics of the DFPP treatments for critical care are summarized. During the DFPP treatments, the patient's blood volume (BV) often decreases with time due to albumin loss induced by inadequate albumin infusion in a supplementation fluid. We examined the change of BV by a continuous hematocrit monitor, Crit-Line, during an in vivo study for 9 patients. As a result, albumin loss fairly occurred in DFPP treatments. The decrease of patient BV was induced by an oncotic pressure drop due to albumin loss and often resulted in a blood pressure drop. This is a serious problem for DFPP in critical care.

The following clinical questions were generated that were representative of the type of problems encountered by occupational health physicians: is work a cause of health problems and is impaired health a cause of diminished work capacity for a specific job? Answers were generated according to the method used in evidence-based medicine by formulating an answerable question, searching the literature, critically appraising the results, and applying the results to the clinical question. Answers were found to all the questions in a reasonable amount of time. The searches revealed a need for more systematic reviews and studies that use work-related health outcomes like return to work. However, there is more evidence available in Medline than is generally assumed by occupational health physicians. Using this evidence led to better clinical decisions. Pitfalls during the literature search were typing mistakes, problems in using medical subject headings, and unreliable search strategies. With the use of the abstracts only, most clinical questions could be answered satisfactorily, but concrete risk estimates were often lacking. The lack of availability of full text journals decreased the reliability of the critical appraisal and risk estimation.

Salmonella infections are a serious public health problem in developing countries and represent a constant concern for the food industry. The severity and the outcome of a systemic Salmonella infection depends on the \"virulence\" of the bacteria, on the infectious dose as well as on the genetic makeup and immunological status of the host. The control of bacterial growth in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the early phases of a Salmonella infection relies on the NADPH oxidase-dependent anti-microbial functions of resident phagocytes and is controlled by the innate resistance gene Nramp1. This early phase is followed by the suppression of Salmonella growth in the RES due to the onset of an adaptive host response. This response relies on the concerted action of a number of cytokines (TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12, IL18, and IL15), on the recruitment of inflammatory phagocytes in the tissues and on the activation of the recruited cells. Phagocytes control bacterial growth in this phase of the infection by producing reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) generated via the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Clearance of the bacteria from the RES at a later stage of the infection requires the CD28-dependent activation of CD4+ TCR-alphabeta T-cells and is controlled by MHC class II genes. Resistance to re-infection with virulent Salmonella micro-organisms requires the presence of Th1 type immunological memory and anti-Salmonella antibodies.

As a single agent in advanced ovarian cancer patients previously treated with a platinum agent, docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks yields a 30% overall response rate and a 6-month duration of response. In vitro data demonstrate a lack of complete cross-resistance between docetaxel and paclitaxel. As a result, antitumor activity has also been demonstrated in patients refractory to a paclitaxel-containing regimen.

Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing surfaces in knee and hip prostheses are frequently manufactured by direct compression moulding of the as-polymerised powder. A study was made of the important role of the temperature-time sequence in the melt state during processing, in determining the mechanical integrity of mouldings at 37 degrees C. Structural features were determined by calorimetry (for the degree of crystallinity), infra-red spectroscopy (for the degree of oxidation), density measurement, and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical integrity was assessed by tensile tests at a constant nominal strain-rate of 10(-3) s(-1), with post-failure microscopic examination. For the whole range of melt temperatures 145-200 degrees C and times 10-90 min, essentially the same stress-strain path was followed, reflecting invariance of the degree of crystallinity. However, there were dramatic changes in elongation-to-break, from ca 10% for some mouldings at 145 degrees C to a mean of 560% at 175 degrees C where, at the 86% confidence level, there was evidence for a peak. The rise was explained by microscopy, that revealed two distinct types of fusion defect, of reducing severity with increasing temperature. Type 1 defects were voids arising from incomplete powder compaction, and persisted up to 165 degrees C. Type 2 defects were regions of enhanced deformability at inter-particle boundaries in apparently fully compacted mouldings, evidenced microscopically by localised relative displacements at particle interfaces, during the plastic deformation at 37 degrees C. They persisted up to 200 degrees C. Type 2 defects may be attributed to the slow self-diffusion of UHMWPE in the melt, leading to incomplete homogenisation. even after compaction is complete.

The defining histopathologic feature of progressive supranuclear palsy is an intracerebral aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau with preferential involvement of the subthalamic nucleus, pallidum, striatum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, pontine tegmentum, oculomotor nucleus, medulla, and dentate nucleus. [3] The aggregates predominantly contain tau isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats (4R-tau) in neurofibrillary tangles, oligodendrocytic coils, and astrocytic tufts. [4] [22] [23] Normally, tau is phosphorylated on a series of serine and threonine residues, regulated by numerous kinases and phosphatases. In progressive supranuclear palsy and other tauopathies, the tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, which causes it to lose its affinity for microtubules and become resistant to proteolysis. This results in the accumulation of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. [24] Definite diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy currently requires neuropathological examination.

The membrane pore size of a hemofilter used for CHF/CHDF allows passage of substances ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 Da, and the method for solute removal in CHF/CHDF employs the principle of convection, which is advantageous for removing middle- to high-molecular-weight substances. As apheresis therapy to remove pathogenic substances in blood, CHF/CHDF is therefore being investigated for its possible effect on various morbid conditions. It has recently been found that CHF/CHDF removes humoral mediators including cytokines, particularly in severe systemic inflammatory response syndromes such as septic shock and severe acute pancreatitis. CHF/CHDF is thus beginning to be performed for the prevention and treatment of organ dysfunction secondary to septic shock, trauma, or acute pancreatitis.

The association between the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component (E2) of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is clinically established. However, the detailed pathological function of the PDC-E2 gene is as yet unclear. In order to study the gene function in knockout and transgenic mouse models, we cloned and characterized the mouse PDC-E2 (mPDC-E2) gene. Because the expression level of PDC-E2 was elevated in PBC bile duct cells, we tried to construct a bile duct carcinoma cell line that overexpressed PDC-E2 as a PBC cell model. The mPDC-E2 cDNA was obtained by the 3'Race method. We overexpressed this gene in KMBC cells, using a retrovirus vector. The transcript and translated protein of mPDC-E2 were detected by Northern blot and Western blot, respectively. The deduced amino-acid sequence from the cloned cDNA indicated that the fully mature protein consisted of 557 amino-acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 59kD. This mature protein was highly consistent with those of previously reported rat and human PDC-E2, which possessed three structurally identifiable regions: the lipoyl-bearing domain, the E3-binding site, and the catalytic domain. Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells expressed one species of mPDC-E2 mRNA, 3.5kb in length. We also successfully constructed a stable KMBC cell line overexpressing the PDC-E2.

In spite of this, consensus if often taken as a truth, which may hamper the production, funding and/or publication of new and original ideas and views. Comparison of the classic view with one of the many other possible views. The consensus view states that 1) SS is initiated and/or caused by an exogenous agent, probably some type of retrovirus, and 2) after initiation, a straightforward sequence of events follows: a) salivary gland epithelial cells are disrupted, b) T lymphocytes migrate to and are activated in the glands, c) B cells get the help they need and start to produce SS and RF autoantibodies, which processes lead to structural destruction and loss of acinar cells and, thus, to sicca symptoms (an example of the linear, step-by-step \"computer\" logic). The problems inherent to this view include: 1) why women? (gender aspect), 2) why at the age of 50? (chronobiologic aspect), 3) is the normal immune system in SS only responding to normal (formely sequestrated) autoantigens? Is the loss of exocrine gland function really caused by \"autoimmune\" destruction? - or do the SS-autoantibodies and lymphocyte infiltrates only represent markers in an appropriate HLA background? (autoimmune aspect), 4) are the retroviral diseases really similar to SS? (exogenous rs endogenous causes), 5) is our current view compatible with unexpected, future findings? Is the textbook interpretation the final truth (evolutionary aspect of our view on pathogenesis). The tubuloalveolar exocrine glands may be seen as 1) locus minoris resistentiae for normal oral microbial flora and immune-inflammatory attacks at the normal environment-host interface. Apoptotic and/or necrotic cells are released into the intraluminal space and pass in normal glands through normal, immunologically competent lymphocyte foci and/or ectopic lymphatic tissue.

We examined the sensitivity and efficiency of simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) analysis of microsatellites and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of minisatellites with commercial, human, and synthetic mouse minisatellite probes. Although no polymorphisms were detected with the microsatellite analysis, certain minisatellite probes detected a small degree of polymorphism between our mouse substrains and the commercially available strains used as controls. Minisatellite probes also detected intra-substrain variation within our colonies; this variation probably represents mutations in highly unstable loci rather than genetic variation.

The purpose of this paper is to present a critique of the current view that reduces cancer to a cellular problem caused by specific gene mutations and to propose, instead, that such a problem might become more intelligible, if it is understood as a phenomenon which results from the breakdown of the morphological plan or Gestalt of the organism. Such an organism, in Aristotelian terms, is characterised for presenting a specific morpho or logos (form) and for having a telos (end) to fulfill. A malignant tumour represents an entity separated from both, the organic logos and the organic telos. According to the basic postulates of Semiophysics--a blend of Aristotelian physics and Catastrophe Theory developed by René Thom--an organism is a source (original) form individuated by a dominant pregnancy which corresponds to its morphogenetic field. Here it is suggested that cancer in aged individuals may result from the progressive exhaustion of the developmental constraints that regulate the process of ontogeny, that is expected to go from the fertilised non-differentiated zygote to the mature fully-developed organism, because there is no further point ahead in the developmental pathway past the reproductive age. Cancer in young individuals (before their reproductive maturity) may then be consequence of premature derangement of such fundamental developmental constraints. In all cases the result is the loss of morphological coherence within the organism.

A better understanding of the molecular events responsible for the development of drug resistance in cancer cells has emerged in recent years. It is now established that tumor cells can acquire drug resistance by alterations of pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis and that failure to activate this pathway in cancer cells may confer resistance to chemotherapy. This resistance to drug-induced apoptosis is likely to play an important role in tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy. The identification of points in the apoptotic pathway at which dysregulation occurs opens up new therapeutic opportunities in situations where conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy approaches fail.

Other factors, however, may be addressed more readily. These include: absence of a medical response culture, discomfort with the role of medical intervention, insecurity with the use of medical devices, a lack of proactive medical direction, infrequent refresher training, and dependence on EMS intervention. Panelists agreed that successful LEA-D programs possess ten key attributes (Table 6). In the end, the goal remains \"early\" defibrillation, not \"police\" defibrillation. It does not matter whether the rescuer wears a blue uniform--or any uniform, for that matter--so long as the defibrillator reaches the victim quickly. If LEA personnel routinely arrive at medical emergencies after other emergency responders or after 8 minutes have elapsed from the time of collapse, an LEA-D program will be unlikely to provide added value. Similarly, if police frequently arrive first, but the department is unwilling or unable to cultivate the attributes of successful LEA-D programs, efforts to improve survival may not be realized. In most communities, however, LEA-D programs have tremendous lifesaving potential and are well worth the investment of time and resources.

Mitochondria have been suggested as key players in apoptotic cell death of neurons and many other tissues, since the release of proapoptotic molecules from mitochondria is implicated in caspase activation. As a potential release mechanism, the occurrence of a large pore opening in the inner membrane (mitochondrial permeability transition pore, PTP) has been proposed, but has not yet been observed directly in neurons. We investigated whether the calcein/Co2+-quenching technique introduced by Petronilli et al. [Biofactors 8 (1998) 263], which allows direct observation of PTP opening, can be applied to neurons. Exposure of calcein-loaded neurons to Co2+ ions resulted in the fading of diffuse cytoplasmic calcein fluorescence, with organelle-restricted fluorescent spots remaining. These spots were colocalized with mitochondrially-entrapped tetramethylrhodamineethylester (TMRE) fluorescence and corresponded to colocalization of calcein and TMRE fluorescence in digitonin-permeabilized neurons. Importantly, extensive neuronal calcium loading, which is assumed to induce PTP opening, resulted in significant fading of mitochondrial fluorescence, suggesting the occurrence of permeability transition. This fluorescence decrease could be completely prevented by the PTP blocker cyclosporin A.", "answer": "Mitochondria play a crucial role in apoptotic cell death by releasing proapoptotic molecules that activate caspases, potentially through the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.", "covered": false}

Ophthalmologic visits account for about 3% of emergency department visits annually.  About 38 to 52% of these visits are for ocular trauma. These injuries range from simple abrasions to catastrophic globe rupture. More than 1 million people worldwide have vision loss bilaterally secondary to trauma. Further, there is an incidence of 500000 cases of unilateral vision loss secondary to trauma, placing it among the leading causes of vision loss. A thorough evaluation of ocular injuries is critical in identifying injuries in an attempt to preserve vision. [1] [2] One test that helps evaluate ocular trauma is the Seidel test. The Seidel test assesses for the presence of aqueous humor leakage from the anterior chamber. This leakage is from a defect in the cornea or sclera from multiple causes, including trauma, post-surgical leak, corneal perforation, and corneal degeneration. The test was first described in 1921 by Dr. Erich Seidel (1882-1948), a German ophthalmologist, for which the test is named. He used the test to evaluate leakage in the postoperative patient but later expanded its use to other causes or anterior chamber leakage.

Viscera not under the domes of the diaphragm are supported and protected predominantly by the muscular walls of the abdomen. One of the most important roles of the abdominal wall is to assist in breathing: It relaxes during inspiration to accommodate expansion of the thoracic cavity and the inferior displacement of abdominal viscera during contraction of the diaphragm (Fig. 4.3). During expiration, it contracts to assist in elevating the domes of the diaphragm, thus reducing thoracic volume. Material can be expelled from the airway by forced expiration using the abdominal muscles, as in coughing or sneezing. Contraction of abdominal wall muscles can dramatically increase intraabdominal pressure when the diaphragm is in a fixed position (Fig. 4.4). Air is retained in the lungs by closing valves in the larynx in the neck. Increased intra-abdominal pressure assists in voiding the contents of the bladder and rectum and in giving birth.", "answer": "The abdominal wall assists in breathing by relaxing during inspiration to allow for the expansion of the thoracic cavity and contracting during expiration to help elevate the diaphragm, reducing thoracic volume.", "covered": true}

Providing resources depends on the definitions of a specific pathogen-free (SPF) macaque, a B virus-free macaque, and a serologically negative macaque. Many colony managers define a B virus-free macaque in light of the serologic status of the breeding colony, because virus identification is a more complex issue. The lack of a standardized definition of a B virus-free macaque is compounded by the fact that all assays inherently result in some false antibody-positive or -negative data, and reconciliation is equivocal. Long-term follow-up of a colony in which elimination of B virus is actively being attempted will necessarily result in a relatively small sample within the population being incorrectly categorized with regard to antibody status.

Acetylcholine, which mainly activates cortical neurons, is released at the maximal rate during waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreaming stage. Its importance in mental functioning is well-known. However, brainstem-generated monoamines, which mainly inhibit cortical neurons, are released during waking. Both kinds of influences contribute to the organized mentation of waking. During slow wave sleep, these two types of influence decrease in intensity but maintain a sufficiently high level to allow mental activity involving fairly abstract pseudo-thoughts, a mode of activity modelled on the diurnal pattern of which it is a poor reply. During REM sleep, the monoaminergic neurons become silent except for the dopaminergic ones. This results in a large disinhibition and the maintained dopamine influence may be involved in the familiar psychotic-like mental activity of dreaming. Indeed, in this original activation-disinhibition state, the increase of dopamine influence at the prefrontal cortex level could explain the almost total absence of negative symptoms of schizophrenia during dreaming, while an increase in the nucleus accumbens is possibly responsible for hallucinations and delusions, which are regular features of mentation during this sleep stage.", "answer": "The absence of negative symptoms of schizophrenia during dreaming can be explained by the increased dopamine influence at the prefrontal cortex level during REM sleep, which results from the disinhibition caused by the silencing of monoaminergic neurons except for the dopaminergic ones.", "covered": false}

Respiratory muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease causes significant morbidity and mortality. The published data on respiratory muscle activity and breathing during sleep in normal subjects, the impact of respiratory muscle weakness on sleep and breathing and the relations to daytime respiratory function in neuromuscular disease are reviewed here. In normal subjects during sleep upper airway resistance increases, chemosensitivity is reduced and the wakefulness drive to breathe is lost, resulting in a fall in ventilation. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, ribcage and accessory breathing muscles are suppressed, particularly during bursts of eye movements, and breathing is more irregular, rapid and shallow, with a further fall in ventilation. In subjects with respiratory muscle weakness sleep is fragmented, with shorter total sleep time, frequent arousals, an increase in stage 1 sleep and a reduction in, or complete suppression of, REM sleep. Sleep-disordered breathing and nocturnal desaturation are common and most severe during REM sleep. Correlations between daytime respiratory function and nocturnal desaturation are moderate or weak, but daytime respiratory function has greater prognostic value than nocturnal measurements.

In Zimbabwe, observations were made of the behaviour of individual stable flies (Stomoxys spp.) (Diptera: Muscidae) and tsetse (Glossina spp.) (Diptera: Glossinidae) feeding on cattle during the wet (Stomoxys and tsetse) and dry (tsetse only) seasons. For Stomoxys landing on adult cattle, only 27% took a full meal (mean feeding time = 147 s). Most Stomoxys left the host before completing their meal, largely due to disturbance by the host's defensive behaviour (24%, mean time = 59 s) or other flies (44%, 71 s). The probability of a Stomoxys leaving the host progressively increased with time. Simultaneous observations of tsetse showed that, compared to Stomoxys, their feeding success was lower (15%), feeding was interrupted earlier (33 s) and the time taken to complete a meal was shorter (109 s). Further studies of tsetse across different seasons and hosts showed that feeding success varied according to host age (adult = 7%; calf = 3%) and was negatively correlated with the frequency of host defensive behaviour and the relative abundance of non-biting Diptera. Disturbances were more often caused by host behaviour (69%) than other flies (31%) and the probability of tsetse leaving decreased with time on the host. Overall, these results suggest that tsetse and Stomoxys have different feeding strategies. In particular, tsetse appear to be more responsive to host defensive behaviour, which reduces their feeding success relative to Stomoxys. These behavioural differences are consistent with the respective life-history characteristics of Stomoxys and tsetse.", "answer": "Tsetse flies are more impacted by host behavior disturbances than Stomoxys, leading to lower feeding success.", "covered": false}

The chances of integration between an implant and the surrounding bone tissue depend on the surface characteristics of the implant itself. Particularly, chemical composition and surface roughness of the material have emerged as crucial factors in affecting the behaviour of cells in contact with the material. Among various surfaces, calcium phosphate coatings seem to favour a rapid initial integration, but their dissolution by extracellular fluids raises some concern about the long-term stability at the bone-implant interface. Fluorinated apatites are known to be more stable than other ceramic coatings, but, at present, little is known on their effects on human cells. In this study, MG63 osteoblast-like cells were seeded onto two fluorohydroxyapatite (FHA)-coated titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) materials differing in roughness, respectively, LR-FHA (Ra = 5.6 microm) and HR-FHA (Ra = 21.2 microm). Quantification of the cells in contact with the FHA-coated materials by conventional methods involved some technical difficulties, on which we report. Only the indirect esteem by the measure of total content of proteins and a procedure based on cell count, following a double enzymatic treatment to detach the cells, offered plain results, indicating no significant differences between cellular growth in contact with test materials and with plastic control. Differentiation and functionality of the cells were comparatively evaluated by analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production. As far as osteocalcin release is concerned, only slight variations were detected on FHA-coated materials in comparison with the control. Both types of coatings showed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity with respect to the control, the roughest surface exhibiting a more prolonged effect on the time.", "answer": "Osteocalcin production showed only slight variations, while alkaline phosphatase activity significantly increased, especially on the rougher surface.", "covered": false}

The threshold of change model (TCM) is a statistical technique for analyzing ordered stages of change variables. TCM focuses on the thresholds that separate the ordered stages, and the effects of explanatory variables are evaluated in terms of raising or lowering the thresholds. TCM also allows the explanatory variables to exert differential influence on each threshold. In this paper, we use TCM to analyze the data from a clinical trial that compared assertive community treatment (ACT) with standard case management (SCM) for patients with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder. Endpoint data (36-month follow up) were used for this analysis. The response variable is the recoded Substance Abuse Treatment Scale with three ordered levels (engagement/persuasion, active treatment, and recovery/relapse prevention), and hence two thresholds. The explanatory variables are gender and group (ACT vs. SCM). The results indicate that gender exerts constant and significant effects on both thresholds.

The clinical appearance of leukemia cutis is variable and may range from papules and nodules to a generalized cutaneous eruption and erythroderma. The histopathologic examination of the skin lesion is essential for diagnosis of leukemia cutis. Specific skin lesions are usually observed in patients with an aggressive clinical course and are associated with a poor prognosis. However, an overall survival of patients with specific skin lesions of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is significantly better, as compared with other types of leukemia. Rarely, skin lesions containing leukemic cells are present before evidence of leukemia cutis can be detected in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (aleukemic leukaemia cutis).

Attempts to improve the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies have led to the development of innovative strategies that combine the high specificity of antibody molecules with the efficient trafficking properties and effector functions of immune cells. These antigen-selective cell therapies are designed to convert therapeutically important native antigens expressed on the cell surface (tumor associated antigens, viral envelope proteins) into recruitment points of effector functions, and address the goal of major histocompatibility complex- and exogenous cytokine-independent activation of mature effector T-cells. The most promising and best characterized antigen-selective strategy is based on the genetic manipulation of the recognition specificity of T-cells by grafting the recognition specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a lymphocyte triggering molecule (TCR-associated polypeptides, Fc epsilon RI-gamma chain). Upon encountering specific antigen, cells harboring chimeric immune receptors (CIRs) are able to undergo specific stimulation and kill antigen bearing cells in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Initial studies have focused on terminally differentiated effector cell-based protocols. However, recent data indicate that progenitor cell-based therapies allow the permanent generation of stable populations of CIR-expressing cells of multiple lineages, leading to long-term persistent systemic immunity. Emerging gene therapy strategies are based on the use of biespecic antibody fragments. The advantages of these biespecic antibody-mediated immune recruitment (BIR) approaches (trans-recruitment and multieffector activation) could complement conventional CIR-based immunotherapies.

Interleukin (IL)-12 and antibodies against CD40 have demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of in vivo model systems. However, both agents can also mediate significant toxicities either when used following lethal TBI or when administered in combination with other agents such as IL-2. In this study, we assessed the effects of anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and IL-12 in lethally irradiated mice. Acute lethal toxicity was observed following the administration of either 10 microg anti-CD40 MoAb (FGK45) or 0.5 microg of recombinant murine (rm)IL-12 that resulted in 100% mortality of all mice within 4 to 6 days. Histological evaluation revealed destruction of the normal gut architecture in both anti-CD40 MoAb- and rmIL-12-treated mice. Analysis of serum cytokine levels in the lethally irradiated mice receiving anti-CD40 MoAb demonstrated a marked increase of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-12 p40, whereas mice receiving rmIL-12 demonstrated a marked increase of IFN-gamma. Lethally irradiated IL-12 p40 knock-out mice were resistant to anti-CD40-induced toxicity, suggesting that the lack of IL-12 p40 with no possibility of making functional IL- 12 p70 is key for this toxic reaction. Similarly, lethally irradiated IFN-gamma knock-out mice were completely resistant to rmIL-12-induced toxicity, suggesting that IFN-gamma is a major player in IL-12-mediated toxicity.

A new concept of cardioprotection based on the exploitation of endogenous mechanisms is known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). It has been hypothesized that substances released during brief ischemic stress (e.g. catecholamines) stimulate the receptors and trigger multiple cell signaling cascades. Opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels [K(ATP)] has been suggested as a possible final step in the mechanisms of protection. In this study, the role of adrenergic activation was tested in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to test ischemia (TI; 30 min occlusion of LAD coronary artery) by: 1) mimicking IPC (5 min ischemia, 10 min reperfusion) with short-term (5 min) administration of norepinephrine (NE, 1 microM), 15 min prior to TI; 2) blockade with beta- or alpha1-receptor antagonists, propranolol (10 microM) and prazosin (2 microM), respectively, applied 15 min prior to TI during IPC. The role of K(ATP) opening was examined by perfusion with a K(ATP) blocker glibenclamide (10 microM) during IPC. Both IPC and NE-induced PC effectively reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) to 33% and 37%, respectively, vs 100% in the non-PC controls, whereby ventricular fibrillation (VF) was totally abolished by IPC and markedly suppressed by PC with NE (0% and 10%, respectively, vs 70% in the non-PC hearts; P &lt; 0.05). The severity of arrhythmias (arrhythmia score, AS) was also markedly attenuated by both interventions (IPC: AS 1.7 +/- 0.4; NE-PC: AS 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs AS 4.1 +/- 0.2 in the controls; P &lt; 0.05). Protection was not suppressed by propranolol (VT 28%; VF 14%; AS 2.2 +/- 0.6), whereas prazosin reversed the protective effect of PC (VT 83%; VF 67%; AS 4.0 +/- 0.8). Antiarrhythmic protection afforded by NE-PC was abolished by pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin (25 microg/kg, i.p.) given 48 h prior to the experiments. Glibenclamide did not suppress the IPC-induced protection. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the rat heart to ischemic arrhythmias can be modulated by IPC.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown aetiology. Increased oxidant burden and antioxidant, e.g. glutathione (GSH), deficiency in the lower respiratory tract have been thought to play a role in the progression of IPF. Sputum induction is a safe noninvasive tool to study inflammation in the respiratory tract. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct measurement of GSH in induced sputum supernatant. Sixteen IPF patients and 15 healthy, nonsmoking subjects underwent sputum induction. Total GSH in sputum, saliva and plasma was measured spectrophotometrically. Sputum GSH was decreased more then four-fold in IPF patients when compared to healthy subjects (mean GSH 1.4+/-0.34 microM versus 5.8+/-0.98 microM). Salivary GSH was generally low or undetectable in all subjects. Plasma GSH levels were lower in IPF patients (0.26+/-0.1 versus 0.74+/-0.16 microM). In IPF patients, there was a borderline correlation of sputum GSH levels with disease duration and lung-function impairment.

The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has dropped precipitously since the introduction of HAART in 1995. Systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) appears to be declining in incidence as well, but to a lesser degree than KS and PCNSL.

They find these neurons in both the stomach and small intestines, and CCK initially activates the afferent fibers in the small intestine via a paracrine mechanism. This inhibits the excitatory vagal efferent pathway to the distal stomach. Gastric vagal afferents are stimulated in response to the hormonal effect coupled with the inhibitory vagal efferent pathway to the proximal stomach. [9] Due to the mechanism mentioned above, CCK can inhibit gastric emptying by relaxing the proximal portion of the stomach, which increases tension in the pyloric sphincter. At high levels of CCK can increase the effect of how fast gastric emptying occurs, and it does this by increasing the excitatory effect it has on both the small and large intestine, which leads to movement in the bowels or by improving the tension of the pyloric sphincter. [5] Therefore, the reflex control of gastric emptying is regulated by CCK action on vasovagal reflexes and the hormonal activation of a variety of pathways that are coupled to vagal efferent pathways controlling gastric motility.", "answer": "CCK inhibits gastric emptying by activating afferent fibers in the small intestine, which inhibits the excitatory vagal efferent pathway to the distal stomach, and by stimulating gastric vagal afferents, leading to relaxation of the proximal stomach and increased tension in the pyloric sphincter.", "covered": true}

This study attempted to determine the feasibility and utility of methods used in evidence-based medicine for some common questions in the practice of occupational medicine. The following clinical questions were generated that were representative of the type of problems encountered by occupational health physicians: is work a cause of health problems and is impaired health a cause of diminished work capacity for a specific job? Answers were generated according to the method used in evidence-based medicine by formulating an answerable question, searching the literature, critically appraising the results, and applying the results to the clinical question. Answers were found to all the questions in a reasonable amount of time. The searches revealed a need for more systematic reviews and studies that use work-related health outcomes like return to work. However, there is more evidence available in Medline than is generally assumed by occupational health physicians. Using this evidence led to better clinical decisions. Pitfalls during the literature search were typing mistakes, problems in using medical subject headings, and unreliable search strategies. With the use of the abstracts only, most clinical questions could be answered satisfactorily, but concrete risk estimates were often lacking. The lack of availability of full text journals decreased the reliability of the critical appraisal and risk estimation.

Recent American Heart Association guidelines suggest amiodarone as an antiarrhythmic in refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). The authors sought to assess the impact of amiodarone use on outcomes and cost associated with this practice in a rural emergency medical services (EMS) state. Statewide EMS records were reviewed for the calendar year 1999. Data reviewed included prehospital diagnosis, medications given by prehospital providers to patients with cardiac arrest, and procedures performed, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Cost-benefit analysis assumed the cost of amiodarone treatment to be $137.65 per patient encounter. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT) analysis utilized resuscitation rates published in the ARREST and ALIVE trials. During the study period, EMS providers diagnosed 2,189 patients as having cardiac arrest. Five hundred thirty-five (24.4%) cardiac arrest patients were defibrillated. One hundred sixty patients (7.3%), including 15 who did not receive defibrillation, were given lidocaine during resuscitation efforts. The annual cost increase from current practice for a statewide amiodarone VF/VT protocol was $21,822.40 (10,572.87%). The initial cost to stock EMS vehicles for this protocol would be $50,115.52. The cost-benefit analysis yielded a potential for one additional patient survival to hospital discharge in Maine per 3.125 years of system-wide practice at a cost of $68,840.00.

The paper focuses on those aspects of literacy competence that are expressed in language as well as aspects of linguistic knowledge that are affected by literacy competence, tracing the route that children take in appropriating linguistic literacy as part of their cognitive abilities and examining the effect of literacy on language across development. Our view of linguistic literacy consists of one defining feature: control over linguistic variation from both a user-dependent ('lectal') and a context-dependent (modality, genre, and register) perspective; of one concomitant process: metalanguage and its role in language development; and of one condition: familiarity with writing and written language from two aspects: written language as discourse style--the recognition that the kind of language used for writing is essentially different from the one used for speech; and written language as a notational system--the perception and growing command of the representational system that is used in the written modality. Linguistic literacy is viewed as a constituent of language knowledge characterized by the availability of multiple linguistic resources and by the ability to consciously access one's own linguistic knowledge and to view language from various perspectives.", "answer": "The defining features of linguistic literacy in the comprehensive model include control over linguistic variation, both user-dependent and context-dependent; the role of metalanguage in language development; and familiarity with writing and written language, encompassing both discourse style and its notational system.", "covered": false}

The name was recently changed in order to avoid any potential confusion with tamoxifen that might lead to errors in dispensing drug.) Children with ADHD were randomized to open-label atomoxetine or methylphenidate for 10 weeks. Response was assessed with the ADHD-IV Rating Scale. Two hundred twenty-eight patients were randomized (atomoxetine n = 184, methylphenidate n = 44).

There has been little work examining the longer term occupational and psychological outcomes of problem-based learn-ing (PBL). The authors aimed to investigate the relationship between psychological distress, occupational factors and experience of PBL in the first cohort of UK pre-registration house officers to be trained exclusively using problem-based methods. Questionnaires were sent to al pre-registration house officers working in the three teaching hospitals in the Manchester area. Measures included demographic items, hours of actual work and the GHQ-12 as a measure of psychological distress, as well as validated Likert scales of job satisfaction, perceived work demands, support from superior,and experience and attitudes towards PBL. The response rate was 87% (66/76). Almost one-third of respondents (20/66) worked more than 72 hours a week. The occupational and psychological measures were significantly interrelated. The multiple regression analysis revealed that work demands and job satisfaction together accounted for over 45% of the variance in psychological distress. The other demographic, occupational and PBL-related factors did not make an independent contribution to distress. Scores were similar for respondents with high and low levels of exposure to PBL, and similar to scores obtained from a previous cohort of house officers graduating from a traditional course. These findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the small size of the current study and the setting. It is possible that as staff and students grow accustomed to new styles of teaching, and work intensity for junior doctors reduces, the effect of PBL will become more evident.

Peat generally has a high adsorption capacity and has been suggested as an adsorbent for metals in polluted waters. However, the adsorption potential of peat can be expected to be strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the water. In this study, the effect of pH, ionic strength (CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations), and metal concentration on Cu and Zn adsorption onto poorly humified Sphagnum and Carex peat was investigated in batch experiments using a fractional factorial experimental design. The pH value was varied between 4 and 8, the CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations between 1.2-6.2 and 0.4-43 mM, respectively, and the Cu and Zn concentrations between 0.05 and 0.5 mM. The amount of Zn adsorbed increased more with increasing pH than the amount of Cu adsorbed. The effect of NaCl/CaCl2 concentration was minor. It was found that Zn adsorption in particular, but also Cu adsorption, increased more with pH onto Carex peat than onto Sphagnum peat. In the pH interval 4-8, the removal of Zn from the solution increased from 0% to 80% using Carex peat and from 10% to 65% using Sphagnum peat as the adsorbent. The Carex peat sample decreased the Cu concentration by 80% at pH 4 and by 95% at pH 8 and for Sphagnum peat a decrease of 85% was maintained in the pH range investigated. The differences between Sphagnum and Carex peat were attributed to the habitat conditions at the time of peat formation. Carex peat has higher ash, nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, while Sphagnum peat contains a higher amount of uronic acid. In treating polluted waters with peat, a higher degree of metal removal can be expected at high pH values than at low. The removal of Cu, which has a high affinity to the peat surface, was less dependent on pH than Zn removal. Poorly humified Carex peat should be chosen in treating wastewaters high in pH.", "answer": "Carex peat is more effective at adsorbing Zn at different pH levels from 4 to 8.", "covered": false}

Besides their function as gene delivery vehicles, lentiviral vector backbones containing the cis-acting sequences necessary to perform a complete replication cycle in the presence of viral proteins provided in trans, have the ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication by several mechanisms that include sequestration of the regulatory proteins Tat and Rev, competition for packaging into virions and possibly by inhibition of reverse transcription in heterodimeric virions. Expression of anti-HIV-1 genes in these vectors would strengthen the potency of this inhibition. To avoid self-inhibition of the vector packaging system, lentiviral vectors have to be modified to become resistant to the anti-HIV-1 genes encoded by them.

The effect of suramin, an inhibitor of G protein regulated signalling, was studied on the membrane currents induced by noxious heat and by capsaicin in cultured dorsal root ganglia neurones isolated from neonatal rats. Whole-cell responses induced by a heat ramp (24-52 degrees C) were little affected by suramin. The noxious heat-activated currents were synergistically facilitated in the presence of 0.3 microM capsaicin 13.2-fold and 6.3-fold at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively. In 65% of neurones, the capsaicin-induced facilitation was inhibited by 10 microM suramin to 35 +/- 6% and 53 +/- 6% of control at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C (S.E.M., n = 15). Suramin 30 microM caused a significant increase in the membrane current produced by a nearly maximal dose (1 microM) of capsaicin over the whole recorded temperature range (2.4-fold at 25 degrees C and 1.2-fold at 48 degrees C).

An update of incidence, mortality, and clinical factors from the SEER database. Concurrent with the successful life-saving efforts in terms of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, some men who do not need treatment are receiving it. These are men destined to die of causes other than prostate cancer. Unfortunately, at diagnosis, men needing treatment for prostate cancer cannot be differentiated from men who do not. To make such decisions correctly for individual patients would require extremely precise measures of the time to death from prostate cancer versus when the patient would die from a competing cause. Predictive tools with this level of accuracy will never be available given the inherent uncertainty of life. At the time of prostate cancer diagnosis, the date and the cause of death for the patient are matters of weak statistical speculation. Unless the date of death from prostate cancer and the date of death from non-prostate cancer causes can be precisely determined for each patient, some men will always be overtreated or undertreated. Conservative strategies result in the undertreatment of some patients who would benefit from treatment while sparing other patients unneeded treatment. Aggressive strategies result in the overtreatment of patients who do not need therapy while curing other men of prostate cancer. Both strategies are correct, but only some of the time. Better methods of determining the length of life and cause of death may improve this situation, but not by much. [figure: see text] Dramatic shifts in the incidence, grade, stage, and age of men with prostate cancer have been observed with the advent of widespread PSA-based cancer detection in the United States. Grade and stage trends suggest that more biologically relevant (the shift from well-differentiated to moderately differentiated tumors) and yet therapeutically amenable (earlier stage) tumors have been identified in large numbers of patients during the PSA era. Clearly many men have been diagnosed and treated who will not benefit from such treatment. The relative mix of these two groups of men is not known.

Current data and future directions as front-line therapy. Docetaxel (Taxotere) has shown activity both as a single-agent and in combination with multiple other cytotoxic agents in the front-line therapy of advanced, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Combinations of docetaxel with the platinum agents have been the most extensively studied in the front-line setting and have produced notably high response rates and encouraging median survivals. When compared to the paclitaxel/cisplatinum combination in a large, phase III randomized trial, the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin resulted in similar response, median survival, and 1-year survival rates. Another randomized phase III trial compared docetaxel/platinum combinations to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vinorelbine (Navelbine)/cisplatin regimen. The docetaxel/cisplatin combination produced a superior overall survival, 2-year survival, and overall response rates compared to vinorelbine/cisplatin.

In spite of this, consensus if often taken as a truth, which may hamper the production, funding and/or publication of new and original ideas and views. Comparison of the classic view with one of the many other possible views. The consensus view states that 1) SS is initiated and/or caused by an exogenous agent, probably some type of retrovirus, and 2) after initiation, a straightforward sequence of events follows: a) salivary gland epithelial cells are disrupted, b) T lymphocytes migrate to and are activated in the glands, c) B cells get the help they need and start to produce SS and RF autoantibodies, which processes lead to structural destruction and loss of acinar cells and, thus, to sicca symptoms (an example of the linear, step-by-step \"computer\" logic). The problems inherent to this view include: 1) why women? (gender aspect), 2) why at the age of 50? (chronobiologic aspect), 3) is the normal immune system in SS only responding to normal (formely sequestrated) autoantigens? Is the loss of exocrine gland function really caused by \"autoimmune\" destruction? - or do the SS-autoantibodies and lymphocyte infiltrates only represent markers in an appropriate HLA background? (autoimmune aspect), 4) are the retroviral diseases really similar to SS? (exogenous rs endogenous causes), 5) is our current view compatible with unexpected, future findings? Is the textbook interpretation the final truth (evolutionary aspect of our view on pathogenesis). The tubuloalveolar exocrine glands may be seen as 1) locus minoris resistentiae for normal oral microbial flora and immune-inflammatory attacks at the normal environment-host interface. Apoptotic and/or necrotic cells are released into the intraluminal space and pass in normal glands through normal, immunologically competent lymphocyte foci and/or ectopic lymphatic tissue.

In idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH), repeated alveolar hemorrhage causes the accumulation of hemosiderin, a by-product of hemoglobin breakdown, in the alveoli. Alveolar macrophages take up these hemosiderin molecules, usually within 36 - 72 hours, and can remain in the lungs for up to 8 weeks.

Thirty-five cases of SCA aged 6 years and older were identified from a screening of 15,900 current patient files at the Howard University College of Dentistry Dental Clinic. A total of 140 non-SCA control subjects (four per case), frequency-matched on enrollment period (+/- 5 yrs) and age (+/- 2 yrs if under age 21, or +/- 5 yrs if 21 or over), was selected by a nonbiased method from the same dental clinic files.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_1090_1", "question": "How do corticosteroids affect the lipid profile of patients with RA?", "doc_chunk": "Cardiovascular risk profile of antirheumatic agents in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Several new drugs have become available for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These agents include selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, leflunomide and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists. COX-2 inhibitors have a more favourable gastrointestinal adverse effect profile than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the COX-2 inhibitors are also associated with hypertension, oedema and congestive heart failure, the well-known adverse effects of conventional NSAIDs. Patients with treated hypertension should be monitored regularly when conventional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors are administered. At present, there is a considerable debate regarding the risk of cardiovascular events with the COX-2 inhibitors. The available literature gives no unequivocal answers. This matter can only be solved by an appropriate trial assessing the cardiovascular risk of these agents. Patients with RA appear to have an enhanced cardiovascular risk which might be related to an unfavourable lipid profile. Corticosteroids induce hypercholesterolaemia in patients other than those with RA. It was recently shown that total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were low in patients with RA who had a high disease activity. Contrary to the expectation, combination therapy with prednisolone rapidly improved the atherogenic index (total/HDL cholesterol). Ongoing studies investigating this topic are underway. It is not known to what extent corticosteroids induce hypertension in patients with RA. Hence, we advocate blood pressure control for these patients. A small percentage of patients with RA develop hypertension when taking leflunomide, and no other serious cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported in the literature. Blood pressure monitoring is recommended especially in the first months of treatment. TNFalpha antagonists are contraindicated in patients with RA who have congestive heart failure. No specific cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported with the use of these agents in the non-cardiovascular compromised patient. TNFalpha antagonists are the most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs presently available. As inflammation plays an important role in RA as well as in cardiovascular disease and, in view of the increased cardiovascular risk in RA, it is tempting to expect that suppression of inflammation ultimately will lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with RA.", "answer": "Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, can improve the atherogenic index by increasing HDL cholesterol levels in patients with RA, contrary to their usual effect of inducing hypercholesterolemia in other conditions.", "covered": false}

Over the last decade, increasing attention has been paid to the development of systems to deliver drugs for long periods at controlled rates. Some of these systems can deliver drugs continuously for over one year. However, little effort has been given to developing systems for the controlled release of nucleic acids. Recently, a novel gene transfer method which allows prolonged release and expression of plasmid DNA in vivo in normal adult animals was established. In this system, a biocompatible natural polymer such as collagen or its derivatives acts as the carrier for the delivery of DNA vectors. The biomaterial carrying the plasmid DNA was administered into animals and, once introduced, gradually released plasmid DNA in vivo. A single injection of plasmid DNA/biomaterial produced physiologically significant levels of gene-encoding proteins in the local/systemic circulation of animals and resulted in prolonged biological effects. These results suggest that the biomaterials carrying plasmid DNA may enhance the clinical potency of plasmid-based gene transfer, facilitating a more effective and long-term use of naked plasmid vectors for gene therapy. Furthermore, the biomaterials can be removed surgically, minimizing the effect of gene products if some unexpected side effects should be observed after application.

Two New Zealand White rabbits presented with unilateral left rear limb abduction and lateral rotation of the distal left rear limb 2 and 17 days after experimental surgery to create a \"stair step\" in the patellar groove of the left medial femoral chondyle. This procedure was performed after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Radiography revealed a spiral oblique mid-shaft fracture of the left femur in both rabbits. Open fracture reduction was undertaken. Because of the presence of screws and Kirschner-wires in the medial femoral condyle, a lateral approach to surgical correction was chosen. Intramedullary fixation was used to reduce and stabilize the fractures. A 0.062\" Kirschner wire was selected for the intramedullary device, because it was sufficiently flexible to allow easy passage into the femoral canal while being sufficiently stiff to promote reduction of the fracture. In addition, the ends of the fracture were secured with a 0.032\" Kirschner cerclage wire to provide additional control of rotation and angulation. Then we assessed the range of motion of the knee joint to determine fracture stability and ensure that the hardware did not impinge on soft-tissue elements. After closure and application of sterile dressing, the hind legs were hobbled proximal to the hock by using elastic veterinary wrap in a figure-eight pattern to maintain limb alignment and prevent formation of pressure ulcers. Intraoperative fluoroscopic evaluation and postoperative radiographs confirmed fracture reduction. Bruising and seroma formation occurred at the surgical site, and transient anorexia developed. Rabbits were treated with fluids, analgesics, antibiotics, and fitted with Elizabethan collars.

This concept has recently been applied to colorectal cancers, but the method used is unique because oncologic principles of resection are still adhered to for the primary tumor along with en bloc resection of the locoregional mesenteric nodes, some of which are sentinel nodes. Sentinel nodes are ideal for sensitive pathologic techniques of detecting micrometastatic disease, as they often reflect the status of the entire locoregional nodal basin. Gross metastatic nodes reveal significant prognostic information and guide the use of adjuvant therapy in affected patients. However, the detection of micrometastatic disease in sentinel nodes by sensitive pathologic methods has not been proven to result in poor prognosis or benefit from adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer.", "answer": "The significance of the sentinel node in colorectal carcinoma is in providing accurate staging and detecting micrometastatic disease, which can guide the use of adjuvant therapy.", "covered": false}

Atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western world. Vascular occlusion caused by atherosclerosis usually requires invasive treatment, such as surgical bypass or angioplasty. However, bypass graft failure and restenosis limit the usefulness of these procedures, with 20% of patients needing a new revascularisation procedure within 6 months of angioplasty. Numerous pharmacological agents have been investigated for the prevention of restenosis but none has shown undisputed efficacy in clinical medicine. Gene transfer offers a novel approach to the treatment of restenosis because of easy accessibility of vessels and already existing gene delivery methods. It can be used to overexpress therapeutically important proteins locally without high systemic toxicity, and the therapeutic effect can be targeted to a particular pathophysiological event. Promising results have been obtained from many pre-clinical experiments using therapeutic genes or oligonucleotides to prevent restenosis. Early clinical trials have shown that plasmid- and adenovirus-mediated vascular gene transfers can be conducted safely and are well tolerated. Ex vivo gene therapy with E2F-decoy succeeded in reducing graft occlusion rate after surgical bypass in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial. In the future, further development of gene delivery methods and vectors is needed to improve the efficacy and safety of gene therapy. Also, better knowledge of vascular biology at the molecular level is needed to find optimal strategies and gene combinations to treat restenosis.

Deep group of back muscles The deep or intrinsic muscles of the back extend from the pelvis to the skull and are innervated by segmental branches of the posterior rami of spinal nerves. They include: the extensors and rotators of the head and neck— the splenius capitis and cervicis (spinotransversales muscles), the extensors and rotators of the vertebral column—the erector spinae and transversospinales, and the short segmental muscles—the interspinales and intertransversarii. The vascular supply to this deep group of muscles is through branches of the vertebral, deep cervical, occipital, transverse cervical, posterior intercostal, subcostal, lumbar, and lateral sacral arteries. The thoracolumbar fascia covers the deep muscles of the back and trunk (Fig. 2.48). This fascial layer is critical to the overall organization and integrity of the region: Superiorly, it passes anteriorly to the serratus posterior muscle and is continuous with deep fascia in the neck.", "answer": "The deep muscles of the back are innervated by segmental branches of the posterior rami of spinal nerves.", "covered": true}

Current applications and future promise. Docetaxel (Taxotere)-based regimens can be included among the most effective treatment options for the management of patients with advanced, androgen-independent prostate cancer. Results with docetaxel as a single agent and in combination regimens with estramustine (Emcyt) have consistently achieved a palliative response, reduced serum PSA levels by &gt; or = 50%, and produced objective responses in patients with measurable disease. In addition, encouraging survival data have been demonstrated in several phase II trials. The ability to administer docetaxel on a weekly basis has substantially enhanced research efforts for treatment in prostate cancer patients. The results of ongoing phase III randomized trials evaluating docetaxel regimens in androgen-independent prostate cancer are eagerly awaited for their potential to definitively demonstrate a beneficial impact on overall patient survival. Docetaxel-containing regimens are likely to demonstrate a substantial role in the management of early-stage prostate cancer patients in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, where clinical investigations are under way. In addition, study results from ongoing trials that integrate docetaxel with hormonal therapies for patients with biochemical recurrence following definitive local treatments will be important in refining the future role of chemotherapy for prostate cancer in general. The preliminary findings from studies conducted with docetaxel are encouraging and await final analysis. Finally, preliminary results from studies exploring combination regimens of docetaxel and novel agents that possess completely different mechanisms of action (eg, proapoptotic agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, and vitamin D analogs) have demonstrated the regimens to be feasible and safe, with promising early response data.

This study considered the inputs of antifouling paint booster biocides into the aquatic environment directly from painted hulls and high pressure hosing operations, the occurrence of booster biocides in marinas, harbours and docks, and the influence of degradation and water-sediment partition on their environmental fate. Irgarol 1051, the Irgarol 1051 degradation product GS26575, diuron, and the diuron degradation products 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3,1-dimethylurea (CPDU), 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea (DCPMU) and 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea (DCPU) were all detected at measurable concentrations in surface waters. Irgarol 1051, GS26575 and diuron were also detected in bottom sediments. A preliminary study of biocide input during both normal use and foreshore hull hosing showed that hosing may be a significant point source input and also be a cause for future concern since much of this input is in the form of paint particles. Field based measurements and laboratory experiments showed that Irgarol 1051 and diuron persist in the water column, due to a low affinity to partition onto sedimentary material and high resistance to degradation.

During a computerized version of SERT practice, students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. The similarity between human judgments and LSA indicates that LSA will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a Web-based version of SERT.", "answer": "Student strategies during the computerized practice were assessed by analyzing their typed self-explanations to determine the extent to which they used information from the current sentence, prior text, or world knowledge.

We designed a new method of measuring gastric emptying and orocecal transit time (OCTT) at the same time to assess the influence of gastric emptying upon OCTT. Twenty-five dyspeptic patients (6 men, 19 women) with a mean age of 64.8 years (range, 25-80 years) were studied. The patients received a liquid test meal, containing 100 mg of 13C-acetate and 12g of lactulose, while they were in the sitting position after an overnight fast. Breath samples were collected at 10-min intervals of 120 min and both 13CO2 and hydrogen (H2) levels were measured. Subsequently, H2 concentrations were measured at 30-min intervals, for a total of 240 min. The results of gastric emptying were expressed as the time of peak 13CO2 excretion. OCTT was defined as the period between the ingestion of lactulose and a H2 peak rise of 5 ppm above the baseline value. The onset of H2 enrichment in the breath began at 90-110 min, whereas 13CO2 levels increased from the beginning, with peak enrichment values being reached after 60-80 min. OCTT was related to 13CO2 peak time. In 5 of the 25 patients, H2 breath enrichment in the 10-min sample was more than 5 ppm over the baseline value. All these 5 patients had double or triple peaks in serial breath H2 concentrations. The combination of the lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) with the 13C-acetate breath test, which requires only breath samples, provides us with much information on the gastrointestinal tract; gastric emptying, OCTT, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, colonic fermentation, and oropharyngeal flora.

Besides conventional X-rays, in the diagnostic work up of initial changes in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 3-phase bone scintigraphy (3P-Sz) is as well established as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of the newly developed low field MRI with the proven methods X-rays and 3P-Sz. 65 patients (47f, 18m; 20-86 yrs) were studied on a one day protocol with 3P-Sz (550 MBq Tc-99m DPD), MRI and X-rays of the hands. Images were visually analysed by two blinded nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists and classified as a) RA-typical, b) inflammatory, non-RA-typical and c) non inflammatory changes. All methods were compared to 3P-Sz as golden standard. In comparison to 3P-Sz, low field MRI presents with almost equal sensitivity and specificity in rheumatoid-typical and inflammatory changes. Conventional X-rays revealed in arthritis-typical changes as well as in inflammatory changes a significantly lower sensitivity and also a lower negative predictive value while specificity equals the one of MRI. Quantitative analysis of 3P-Sz using ROI-technique unveiled significantly higher values in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in those with no inflammatory changes. MRI represents an equally sensitive method in the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid-typical and inflammatory changes in the region of the hands as compared to the 3P-Sz. Besides the basic diagnosis with conventional X-rays, 3P-Sz is still the recommended method of choice to evaluate the whole body when RA is suspected.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is associated with heat and water loss from the airways. It is not known whether these conditions can influence the response to bronchoactive agonists. The effects of different degrees of alveolar ventilation on the pulmonary response to methacholine and the role of humidity and temperature in this response were evaluated. Wistar rats were anaesthetized, tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated. Increasing doses of methacholine were infused intravenously and respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) were measured. The rats were ventilated with dry air at 13 degrees C, dry air at 37 degrees C, humid air at 13 degrees C and humid air at 37 degrees C. These four groups were further divided into three subgroups with a respiratory frequency adjusted to reach a carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood of 30, 40 and 50 mmHg. Temperature, humidity and level of alveolar ventilation did not influence the position of the dose/response curve to methacholine. However, the maximal changes in Ers were significantly lower in the rats ventilated with humid air. In addition, maximal changes in Ers were significantly higher in the rats with lower alveolar ventilation. These differences were not observed for maximal values of Rrs. The pulmonary response to methacholine in normal rats is significantly affected by the humidity of inspired air and the level of alveolar ventilation. This influence is more intense in the small airways and/or distal airspaces. This suggests that exercise or hyperventilation can change the behaviour of airway smooth muscle.", "answer": "Lower alveolar ventilation levels resulted in greater changes in elastance (Ers).", "covered": false}

The transesophageal esophagectomy requires an excellent understanding of both gastric and colonic blood supplies as well and thoracic and cervical anatomy. Since the majority of the thoracic dissection is done bluntly and without direct visualization, a surgeon's touch, feel, and knowledge of anatomy is paramount for a successful case. Preoperative planning requires a decision of the conduit that will be presumed as the primary choice. The primary choice for the transhiatal esophagectomy is the gastric tube created on the greater curvature of the stomach. This tube is brought to the neck for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. The tube's blood supply is through the right gastroepiploic artery, and this needs to be preserved as the rest of the blood supply to the stomach is divided. This provides adequate length for the tube to reach into the neck. In the area of the left gastric artery arises an aberrant left hepatic artery at times, which needs to be sought if present and preserved. On occasion, the gastric tube cannot be used, and the left colon is used as the conduit in an isoperistaltic fashion. The blood supply to the left colon is maintained with the left colic artery, and the middle colic is divided. An antiperistaltic left colon can be used as well based on the middle colic artery but is less preferred.

The effects of gold-chloroquine derivatives with the formula [Au(PR3)(CQ)]PF6 (where R = Ph (1), Et or Me) on the superoxide anion production by human neutrophils (PMNs, polymorphonuclear cells) were investigated. When these complexes (0.1-3 mumol/l) were added to PMNs prior to the activators formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), they inhibited isoluminol-horseradish peroxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (CLisol). The inhibition was a direct result of effects on PMNs since chemiluminescence in the cell-free system (horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxidase-isoluminol) was not affected. The above mentioned concentrations of the complexes did not show in vitro toxicity on the cells. On the other hand, when 1 mumol/l of complex 1 was added to cells after stimulation, the chemiluminescence of PMNs stimulated by PMA was inhibited, but not the chemiluminescence stimulated by fMLP.

One of the major hurdles to successful gene therapy of genetic and/or acquired disease is the ability to efficiently introduce a foreign gene into the tissue of interest and, in the case of some genetic diseases, achieve long-term expression of the transgene. Due to their ability to transduce a wide variety of cell types in a cell-cycle independent fashion, adenovirus (Ad)-based vectors have received considerable attention in recent years as delivery vehicles for multiple gene therapy applications. Effective use of early \"first-generation\" versions of these vectors was hampered by not only the induction of strong immune responses in the host to the Ad vector and transduced cells, but also to direct acute and chronic toxicity caused by the vector itself. Furthermore, transgene expression was typically transient, lasting only a few weeks. Despite these limitations, these vectors have been used in a number of human clinical trials, eliciting both interesting as well as controversial results, some of which are summarized herein. Because of these limitations, a number of advances in adenovirus \"vectorology\", manifested primarily as the development of multiply attenuated Ads and vectors deleted of all viral protein coding sequences, has resulted in vectors which retain all of the advantages of Ad vectors and, in addition, do not exhibit the deleterious characteristics associated with [E1-]deleted Ads.

Kinetic analysis suggests that mass transfer or adsorption of TNT controlled the overall rate of TNT reduction to TAT with pure iron, whereas with scrap iron, the rate of TAT formation was probably limited by other processes. Compared to TNT, transformation of adsorbed RDX was more rapid and less affected by iron type. The RDX was reduced to an unidentified, water-soluble intermediate and NH4+, which accounted for approximately 50% of the RDX nitrogen. No total organic carbon reduction was observed before and after RDX transformation with scrap iron.", "answer": "The transformation of RDX differs from TNT when adsorbed to elemental iron in that RDX transformation is more rapid and less affected by the type of iron, resulting in the formation of an unidentified water-soluble intermediate and NH4+, whereas TNT transformation involves a slower reduction to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene with significant adsorption and intermediate accumulation, particularly with scrap iron.", "covered": false}

The deep inguinal nodes, up to three in number, are medial to the femoral vein (Fig. 6.39). The deep inguinal nodes receive lymph from deep lymphatics associated with the femoral vessels and from the glans penis (or clitoris) in the perineum. They interconnect with the superficial inguinal nodes and drain into the external iliac nodes via vessels that pass along the medial side of the femoral vein as it passes under the inguinal ligament. The space through which the lymphatic vessels pass under the inguinal ligament is the femoral canal. In addition to the inguinal nodes, there is a small collection of deep nodes posterior to the knee close to the popliteal vessels (Fig. 6.39).

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_856_0", "question": "What are the distinctions between an umbilical hernia and a para-umbilical hernia?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Umbilical hernias are rare. Occasionally, they are congenital and result from failure of the small bowel to return to the abdominal cavity from the umbilical cord during development. After birth, umbilical hernias may result from incomplete closure of the umbilicus (navel). Overall, most of these hernias close in the first year of life, and surgical repair is not generally attempted until later. Para-umbilical hernias may occur in adults at and around the umbilicus and often have small necks, so requiring surgical treatment. Incisional hernias occur through a defect in a scar of a previous abdominal operation. Usually, the necks of these hernias are wide and do not therefore strangulate the viscera they contain. A spigelian hernia passes upward through the arcuate line into the lateral border at the lower part of the posterior rectus sheath. It may appear as a tender mass on one side of the lower anterior abdominal wall.", "answer": "An umbilical hernia typically occurs due to a failure of the small bowel to return to the abdominal cavity during development or from incomplete closure of the umbilicus after birth, often closing naturally within the first year of life.

A total of 24 students were identified from Years 4 and 5 of the undergraduate medical course at our medical school. Students invited to participate were identified following failure in summative and/or continuous assessment processes. Students underwent an individual educational diagnosis by means of free discussion and a semi-structured interview. Each negotiated a problem list, action plan and learning contract with course tutors. Of the 24 students, 16 received academic support and tutorials. Tutorial content was determined by individual students and took place over a 6-12-month period, initially individually and subsequently in pairs. Regular feedback and appraisal occurred. Information was delivered to the medical school academic progress review system. Student satisfaction was investigated and subsequent examination scores reviewed. The causes of academic failure were widespread and ranged from deficient study skills to financial, domestic and emotional problems. In contrast, the subjects in which students had difficulty were remarkably similar, in that they all related to core clinical skills and frequently involved communication skills.

The generation of unlimited quantities of neural stem and/or progenitor cells derived from the human brain holds great interest for basic and applied neuroscience. In this article we critically review the origins and recent developments of procedures developed for the expansion, perpetuation, identification, and isolation of human neural precursors, as well as their attributes. Factors influencing their in vitro properties, both under division and after differentiation conditions, are evaluated, with the aim of identifying properties common to the different culture systems reported. This analysis suggests that different culture procedures result in cells with different properties, or even in different cells being isolated. With respect to in vivo performance, present evidence obtained in rodents indicate that cultured human neural precursors, in general, are endowed with excellent integrative properties. Differentiation of the implanted cells, in particular in the case of adult recipients, seems not to be complete, and functionality still needs to be demonstrated. In relation to gene transfer and therapy, aspects currently underexplored, initial data support the view that human neural stem and progenitor cells may serve a role as a platform cell for the delivery of bioactive substances to the diseased CNS. Although a large deal of basic research remains to be done, available data illustrate the enormous potential that human neural precursors isolated, expanded, and characterized in vitro hold for therapeutic applications.

Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack.

In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries. The poor prognosis associated with this disease is closely related to the fact that most lung cancer patients are not identified until their malignancy has reached an advanced stage. Recent advances have added to the understanding of the morphological and molecular characteristics of preinvasive bronchial lesions and early lung cancers. Such information is being used to provide new tests for the detection of lung cancer at early or preinvasive stages, and for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention that can prevent progression to advanced disease. Laser induced fluorescence endoscope bronchoscopy has improved the sensitivity with which preinvasive dysplastic bronchial lesions and early invasive malignancies can be detected. Morphological features of such lesions have been described and can be monitored by follow-up bronchoscopies in order to validate potential chemoprevention treatments. Distinct morphological characteristics such as angiogenic squamous dysplasia also suggest that processes like angiogenesis are present early in the development of lung cancer. Furthermore, tissue obtained from these early lesions has been used to describe alterations in the expression of a number of factors that distinguish these early lesions from normal bronchial epithelium. This could provide molecular markers and targets for the detection and treatment of early lung cancer. Studies to detect these alterations by polymerase chain reaction and/or immunhistochemical analyses of easily obtained specimens such as sputa are helping identifing molecular markers that could be utilized in effective screening programmes.

The seasonal changes in the distribution of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) and its main host, cattle, were examined in a cultivated area of the plateau of eastern Zambia. During four consecutive years, the tsetse and cattle populations were monitored along a fly-round transect traversing the two main vegetation types in the study area. These were miombo, a one-storied open woodland with the genera Brachystegia and Julbernardia dominant, and munga, a one- or two-storied woodland where the principal tree genera were Acacia, Combretum and Terminalia. Concurrently, a capture/mark/release/recapture (CMRR) exercise was conducted along two other transects also traversing both vegetation types. The index of apparent abundance of tsetse (IAA) in miombo increased at the beginning of the rainy season (November), reached its peak at the end of the rainy season (April) and was low during the cold season (May to late August), but especially the hot dry season (September to late October). The IAA of tsetse in munga showed a pattern that was the reverse of that in miombo. The seasonal changes in the IAA of tsetse in both vegetation types were in accordance with changes in the movement patterns of tsetse between the two vegetation type as observed using CMRR. The distribution and abundance of cattle along the transect also showed a seasonal trend. This was especially so in munga, during the first three years of observations, where cattle abundance increased gradually from June onwards, reached a maximum at the end of the hot dry season (October-November) and declined steeply at the start of the rainy season (November-December).

The ER-CALUX assay was more sensitive to 17beta-estradiol (E2) than the recombinant yeast screen, with an EC50 of 6 pM E2 compared to 100 pM in the yeast screen. Yeast cells were unable to distinguish the anti-estrogens ICI 182,780 and (4-hydroxy)tamoxifen, which were agonistic in the yeast. Acetone-soluble fractions of hexane/acetone extracts of sediments showed higher estrogenic potency than hexane-soluble extracts in the ER-CALUX assay. Sediments obtained from industrialized areas such as the Port of Rotterdam showed the highest estrogenic potency of the 12 marine sediments tested (up to 40 pmol estradiol equivalents per gram sediment). The estrogenic activity of individual chemicals that can be found in sediments including: alkylphenol ethoxylates and carboxylates; phthalates; and pesticides, was tested. Increasing sidechain length of various nonylphenol ethoxylates resulted in decreased estrogenic activity. Of the phthalates tested, butylbenzylphthalate was the most estrogenic, though with a potency approximately 100,000 times less than E2.

The three resulting 4D-QSAR models are almost identical in form, and all suggest three key ligand-receptor interaction sites. The formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bond involving the proton of the ligand -OH group is the most important binding interaction.

A promising approach in adoptive immunotherapy is based on the induction of a specific cellular anti-tumor response by antigen-specific, cytolytic T cells. Due to difficulties in isolating tumor-specific T cells in sufficient amounts, it was proposed to graft cytolytic T cells with an antigen-specific, recombinant T cell receptor. The antigen binding domain of the receptor consists of a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) that is derived from a monoclonal antibody and binds to a tumor associated antigen. The intracellular signalling domain is derived from the cytoplasmic part of a membrane bound receptor to induce cellular activation, e.g., the Fc epsilon RI receptor gamma-chain or the CD3 zeta-chain. By use of this type of recombinant receptor, the strategy combines the advantages of MHC-independent, antibody-based antigen binding with efficient T cell activation upon specific binding to the receptor ligand. The modular composition of the receptor, moreover, facilitates modification of both the antigen binding and signalling properties. Accordingly, we and others have generated a panel of recombinant T cell receptors with specificities for malignantly or virally transformed cells. Receptor grafted effector cells were demonstrated to mediate a highly efficient immune response towards antigen expressing target cells. However, little is known about the impact of the recombinant receptor modules on recognition of highly heterologous target antigens and on cellular activation in a complex immunological context.

More recently, bootstrap resampling techniques that do not rely on distributional assumptions have been applied to the problem. Here we describe how a more advanced bootstrap methodology may be applied to derive better point estimates and confidence intervals for SSD estimates of safe environmental concentrations. Motivated by the fact that the true SSD may not fit any standard model category, we go on to consider a hybrid bootstrap regression approach. This can yield a substantially different estimate for the SSD when compared with both the basic bootstrap and the more frequently used parametric curve approaches. With increasing use of SSDs in ecological risk assessment, it is now imperative that the scientific community develops agreement over appropriate methods for their derivation.", "answer": "It is important for the scientific community to agree on appropriate methods for deriving SSD estimates to ensure consistency, reliability, and scientific robustness in ecological risk assessments.", "covered": false}

Visual cognitive responses (P300) to moving stimuli were tested in 36 subjects with the aim to find the normal range of P300 parameters. Concomitantly, the circadian intra-individual variability of the P300 was studied in a subgroup of 6 subjects. Visual stimuli consisted of either coherent (frequent stimulus) or non-coherent motion (random stimulus). The oddball paradigm was applied for recording cognitive responses. P300 to rare stimuli had an average latency of 447.3 +/- 46.6 ms and amplitude of 12.9 +/- 6.0 microV. The average reaction time was in the range from 322 to 611 ms and there was no correlation between the reaction time and P300 latency. We did not find any significant circadian changes of the P300 parameters in the 6 subjects tested four times during the same day. Cognitive (event-related) responses (P300) displayed distinctly greater inter-individual variability (S.D. of 50 ms) when compared with pattern-reversal and motion-onset VEPs (S.D. of 6.0 ms and 14 ms, respectively).

In addition to suppressing the mobile phase and enhancing the analyte signal like any other ion chromatography suppressor, the new DS-Plus suppressor removes carbonic acid from the suppressor effluent when carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phases are used. This greatly reduces the background signal, enabling carbonate-hydrogencarbonate gradients. Since carbonate-hydrogencarbonate mobile phase has stronger eluting power than hydroxide or tetraborate, only dilute concentrations are needed to separate most anions. By adjusting the carbonate-hydrogencarbonate ratio in the mobile phase, various anion mixtures including those containing organic and inorganic anions with -1 to -3 charges can be separated on one or two columns, eliminating the needs for columns with special selectivity.", "answer": "The DS-Plus suppressor enhances analyte signal by removing carbonic acid from the suppressor effluent, reducing background signal and enabling effective use of carbonate-hydrogencarbonate gradients.", "covered": false}

Studies on CNS infection via intranasal and peripheral injections with virulent and avirulent replication-competent Semliki Forest virus (SFV) strains has demonstrated the potential of gene delivery. Replication-deficient alphavirus particles have shown high local transgene expression of a transient nature in rodent brain. Alphavirus vectors have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in infected human tumor cell lines and SFV vectors expressing interleukin-12 resulted in tumor regression in a B16 murine melanoma model. Repeated SFV injections led to stronger anti-tumor effects without immunogenic response detected against SFV. It has also been shown that intra-tumoral SFV-injections into nude mice with implanted human lung carcinomas led to tumor regression. Likewise, injection of replicative SFV-LacZ RNA resulted in tumor response as well as prophylactic protection against tumor formation. Alphaviruses have also showed potential in vaccine production. Additionally, modifications in the envelope structure of Sindbis virus resulted in substantial change in host range and demonstrated the feasibility of targeting alphavirus vectors. Moreover, SFV has been used as an expression vector for the generation of high-titer retrovirus-like particles. Recent alphavirus vector development has introduced novel non-cytopathogenic vectors, tightly temperature-regulated vectors as well as replication-persistent forms that should prolong the duration of expression.

The conventional materials were unirradiated (control) and gamma irradiated in nitrogen with a dose of 30 kGy. The highly crosslinked UHMWPEs were gamma irradiated at room temperature with 100 kGy and then thermally processed by either annealing below the melt transition at 100 degrees C or by remelting above the melt transition at 150 degrees C. The true stress-strain behavior of the four UHMWPE materials was characterized as a function of strain rate (between 0.02 and 0.10 s(-1)) and test temperature (20-60 degrees C). Although annealing and remelting of UHMWPE are primarily considered as methods of improving oxidation resistance, thermal processing was found to significantly impact the crystallinity, and hence the mechanical behavior, of the highly crosslinked UHMWPE.

Non-medullary thyroid carcinomas arise from follicular cells. The purpose of this study is to correlate clinical and pathological properties of these tumours with the rate of distant metastasis from a series of thyroid tumours excised at one institution. A total of 311 non-medullary thyroid tumours were identified and divided into: 29 follicular carcinoma (FC), 12 Hürthle cell carcinoma (HC), 13 Hürthle cell papillary thyroid carcinoma (HPTC) with vascular invasion (VI), 32 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with VI and 225 PTC without VI. The mean follow-up was 6.5 years with a range of 1-17 years. The tumours were histologically subdivided into minimal or wide invasion for FC and HC and focal or extensive invasion for PTC and HPTC, and stratified according to status of VI. The rate of distant metastasis was similar for FC, malignant Hürthle cell tumours and PTC with VI, and increased with extent of invasion. VI was seen in 12% of all PTC and 0% of HPTC in this study. PTC without VI were associated with a much lower potential of distant metastasis, were smaller in size and occurred in patients of younger age than PTC with VI. In addition, there was a tendency for increased potential for distant metastases with increased tumour size and patient age for all groups of tumours in the study. Patient age and tumour size appeared to play a smaller role than that of VI in predicting distant metastasis. Our study suggests that the rate of distant metastasis relates to VI, patient age and tumour size, regardless of Hürthle cell, FC or PTC differentiation.

Mercury concentrations were determined in the epiphytic lichen Hypogymnia physodes along five transects starting from a chlor-alkali plant located at Dalhousie, New Brunswick, a landfill site and a nearby electricity generating station. Lichen samples were collected from white birch (Betula papyrifera) and spruce (Picea sp.) or balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Average lichen background mercury values were 0.088+/-0.005 microg/g from white birch and 0.148+/-0.046 microg/g from spruce trees, with a detection limit of 0.05 microg/g. The chlor-alkali plant and a power plant were identified, respectively, as a major source and a minor source of elevated mercury levels in lichens. At 125 m north-west of the New Brunswick Power plant, 0.28 microg/g Hg were found in Hypogymnia physodes from spruce trees, while at 250 m west (downwind) of the chlor-alkali plant, 3.66 microg/g of mercury were determined. High values, 0.98 microg/g in lichens from spruce trees and 0.79 microg/g in lichen samples from white birch were also measured at 125 m south of the chlor-alkali plant and decreased exponentially with distance.

Poorly controlled longstanding diabetes frequently results in sustained hypertension (HTN) which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, hyperglycemia, per se, causes a reversible rise in blood pressure (BP) and increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS activity may raise BP by promoting inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) and/or nonenzymatic generation of vasoconstrictive prostaglandins from peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Therefore, we hypothesized that antioxidant therapy may enhance the BP-lowering effect of glycemia control with insulin replacement in diabetes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by streptozotocin administration and randomized to untreated, antioxidant-treated (vitamin E-fortified food, tocopherol 5000 U/kg chow and vitamin C-fortified H2O, 1000 mg/L), insulin-treated and insulin plus antioxidant-treated groups. Normal rats fed a regular diet or antioxidant-fortified diet served as controls and monitored for 4 weeks. The diabetic animals showed marked hyperglycemia, HTN, proteinuria, depressed tissue glutathione level and elevated plasma lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA) denoting increased ROS activity. Insulin therapy alone resulted in significant, but incomplete reduction in BP and plasma MDA but not proteinuria. Antioxidant therapy alone had no effect on the measured parameters in either the diabetic or control animals. However, combined insulin and antioxidant therapies normalized BP, plasma MDA and urinary protein in the diabetic animals. As expected, uncontrolled diabetes resulted in glomerular hyperfiltration which was partially reversed by insulin therapy, but was unaffected by antioxidant therapy. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia in the early phase of diabetes was associated with elevated plasma MDA, HTN and proteinuria. Insulin therapy alone resulted in significant but incomplete reduction of plasma MDA and BP.

Along with previously determined structures of AmpC in complexes with five other boronic acid inhibitors and four beta-lactams, consensus binding sites were identified. Computationally, the programs GRID, MCSS, and X-SITE were used to predict potential binding site hot spots on AmpC. Several consensus binding sites were identified from the crystal structures. An amide recognition site was identified by the interaction between the carbonyl oxygen in the R1 side chain of beta-lactams and the atom Ndelta2 of the conserved Asn152. Surprisingly, this site also recognizes the aryl rings of arylboronic acids, appearing to form quadrupole-dipole interactions with Asn152. The highly conserved \"oxyanion\" hole defines a site that recognizes both carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. A hydroxyl binding site was identified by the O2 hydroxyl in the boronic acids, which hydrogen bonds with Tyr150 and a conserved water. A hydrophobic site is formed by Leu119 and Leu293. A carboxylate binding site was identified by the ubiquitous C3(4) carboxylate of the beta-lactams, which interacts with Asn346 and Arg349. Four water sites were identified by ordered waters observed in most of the structures; these waters form extensive hydrogen-bonding networks with AmpC and occasionally the ligand. Predictions by the computational programs showed some correlation with the experimentally observed binding sites. Several sites were not predicted, but novel binding sites were suggested. Taken together, a map of binding site hot spots found on AmpC, along with information on the functionality recognized at each site, was constructed. This map may be useful for structure-based inhibitor design against AmpC.", "answer": "X-ray crystallography.", "covered": false}

The cellular joint infiltrate in rheumatoid arthritis patients is rich in CD4-positive T-helper lymphocytes and macrophages, rendering anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suitable for specific immunoscintigraphy of human/experimental arthritis. Following intravenous injection, however, mAbs are present both in the free form and bound to CD4-positive, circulating monocytes and T-cells. Thus, the present study aimed at analyzing the relative contribution of the free and the cell-bound component to the imaging of inflamed joints in experimental adjuvant arthritis (AA). AA rat peritoneal macrophages or lymph node l-cells were incubated in vitro with saturating amounts of 99mTc-anti-CD4 mAb (W3/25) and injected i.v. into rats with AA. In vitro release of 99mTc-anti-CD4 mAb from the cells was limited (on average 1.57%/h for macrophages and 0.84%/h for T-cells). Following i.v. injection, whole body/joint scans and tissue measurements showed only negligible accumulation of radioactivity in inflamed ankle joints (tissue: 0.22 and 0.34% of the injected activity, respectively), whereas the radioactivity was concentrated in liver (tissue: 79% and 71%, respectively), kidney, and urinary bladder.

To examine the ability of 4 published osteoporosis risk indices to identify women with low bone density. Subjects included postmenopausal women 45 years and older consecutively recruited from US clinics, women from general practice centers in The Netherlands (age range, 50-80 years), women in the Rotterdam Study (The Netherlands) 55 years and older, and women aged 55 to 81 years old screened for a clinical trial of alendronate. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the femoral neck or lumbar spine; T scores represent the number of SDs below the mean for young healthy women. One risk index was calculated from age and weight; the other risk indices included up to 4 additional variables obtained by questionnaire. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity for identifying women with BMD T scores of -2.5 or less or -2.0 or less in the US clinic sample and created 3 risk categories, using each of the 4 indices. Data were available for 1102 women from the US clinic sample, 3374 women in the Rotterdam Study, 23,833 women screened for a clinical trial of alendronate, and 4204 women from general practice centers in The Netherlands. Specificity for identifying BMD T scores of -2.5 or less ranged from 37% to 58% (depending on risk index) when sensitivity was approximately 90%. The prevalence of osteoporosis (defined as T scores &lt; or = -2.5) differed widely across the 3 risk categories, ranging from 2% to 4% for the low-risk category to 47% to 61% for the high-risk category in the US clinic sample. For spine BMD in the US clinic sample, the prevalence of T scores of -2.5 or less ranged from 7% (low risk) to 38% (high risk). The large differences in prevalence across risk categories were consistent across the other 3 samples of postmenopausal women in the United States and The Netherlands for all 4 risk indices.

Why does LEA-D intervention seem to work in some systems but not others? Panelists agreed that some factors that delay rapid access to treatment, such as long travel distances in rural areas, may represent insurmountable barriers. Other factors, however, may be addressed more readily. These include: absence of a medical response culture, discomfort with the role of medical intervention, insecurity with the use of medical devices, a lack of proactive medical direction, infrequent refresher training, and dependence on EMS intervention. Panelists agreed that successful LEA-D programs possess ten key attributes (Table 6). In the end, the goal remains \"early\" defibrillation, not \"police\" defibrillation. It does not matter whether the rescuer wears a blue uniform--or any uniform, for that matter--so long as the defibrillator reaches the victim quickly. If LEA personnel routinely arrive at medical emergencies after other emergency responders or after 8 minutes have elapsed from the time of collapse, an LEA-D program will be unlikely to provide added value. Similarly, if police frequently arrive first, but the department is unwilling or unable to cultivate the attributes of successful LEA-D programs, efforts to improve survival may not be realized. In most communities, however, LEA-D programs have tremendous lifesaving potential and are well worth the investment of time and resources. Law enforcement agencies considering adoption of AED programs should review the frequency with which police arrive first at medical emergencies and LEA response intervals to determine whether AED programs might help improve survival in their communities.

Human gene therapy promises to change the practice of medicine by treating the causes of disease rather than the symptoms. Since the first clinical trial made its debut ten years ago, there are over 400 approved protocols in the United States alone, most of which have failed to show convincing data of clinical efficacy. This setback is largely due to the lack of efficient and adequate gene transfer vehicles. With the recent progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of human diseases and the imminent arrival of the post genomic era, there are increasing numbers of therapeutic genes or targets that are available for gene therapy. Therefore, the urgency and need for efficacious gene therapies are greater than ever. Clearly, the current fundamental obstacle is to develop delivery vectors that exhibit high efficacy and specificity of gene transfer. Recombinant adenoviruses have provided a versatile system for gene expression studies and therapeutic applications. Of late, there has been a remarkable increase in adenoviral vector-based clinical trials. Recent endeavors in the development of recombinant adenoviral vectors have focused on modification of virus tropism, accommodation of larger genes, increase in stability and control of transgene expression, and down-modulation of host immune responses.

Peat generally has a high adsorption capacity and has been suggested as an adsorbent for metals in polluted waters. However, the adsorption potential of peat can be expected to be strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the water. In this study, the effect of pH, ionic strength (CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations), and metal concentration on Cu and Zn adsorption onto poorly humified Sphagnum and Carex peat was investigated in batch experiments using a fractional factorial experimental design. The pH value was varied between 4 and 8, the CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations between 1.2-6.2 and 0.4-43 mM, respectively, and the Cu and Zn concentrations between 0.05 and 0.5 mM. The amount of Zn adsorbed increased more with increasing pH than the amount of Cu adsorbed. The effect of NaCl/CaCl2 concentration was minor. It was found that Zn adsorption in particular, but also Cu adsorption, increased more with pH onto Carex peat than onto Sphagnum peat. In the pH interval 4-8, the removal of Zn from the solution increased from 0% to 80% using Carex peat and from 10% to 65% using Sphagnum peat as the adsorbent. The Carex peat sample decreased the Cu concentration by 80% at pH 4 and by 95% at pH 8 and for Sphagnum peat a decrease of 85% was maintained in the pH range investigated. The differences between Sphagnum and Carex peat were attributed to the habitat conditions at the time of peat formation. Carex peat has higher ash, nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, while Sphagnum peat contains a higher amount of uronic acid. In treating polluted waters with peat, a higher degree of metal removal can be expected at high pH values than at low.

The Langmuir, the Polanyi-Dubinin, and the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models were used to simulate single-component sorption in zeolites. The Langmuir two-site, the Polanyi-Dubinin two-site, and the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models were used to simulate single-component sorption in Tenax and natural solids.

By using parameters from the different single-component isotherm models, the multicomponent Langmuir, the ideal adsorbed solution theory, and the Polanyi theory were each used to predict multicomponent sorption. In general, the ability to predict TCE sorption in the presence of PCE depended more on the choice of the single-component model than the multicomponent model, and better results were obtained when the Freundlich or the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm was used for single-component sorption. This suggests that the more mechanistically based Langmuir and Polanyi-type models may not adequately describe the distribution of adsorption sites in some model and natural solids.

By incorporating a grating in a planar optical waveguide one creates a device with which the spectrum of guided lightmodes can he measured. When the surface of the waveguide is exposed to different solutions, the peaks in the spectrum shift due to molecular interactions with the surface. Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) is a highly sensitive technique that is capable of real-time monitoring of these interactions. Since this integrated optical method is based on the measurement of the polarizability density (i.e., refractive index) in the vicinity of the waveguide surface, radioactive, fluorescent or other kinds of labeling are not required. In addition, measurement of at least two guided modes enables the absolute mass of adsorbed molecules to be determined. In this article, the technique will be described in some detail, and applications from different areas will be discussed. Selected examples will be presented to demonstrate how monitoring the modification of different metal oxides with polymers and the response of the coated oxides to biofluids help in the design of novel biomaterials; how OWLS is useful for accurate bioaffinity sensing, which is a key issue in the development of new drugs; and how the quantitative study of protein-DNA/RNA and cell surface interactions can enhance the understanding of processes in molecular and cellular biology.", "answer": "OWLS measures molecular interactions on the surface of a waveguide by monitoring shifts in the spectrum of guided lightmodes, which occur due to changes in the polarizability density (refractive index) near the waveguide surface when exposed to different solutions.

In this article, we re-evaluated and studied the retention efficiencies of 0.2 micron rated nylon 6.6 and 0.22 microns rated modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filters for Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava (ATCC 700892) and R. pickettii (ATCC 700591). Out of a total of forty-four 0.2/0.22 micron rated filters discs tested in this study (spanning different challenge fluids, different challenge conditions, and different filter types), H. pseudoflava penetration was observed for every filter disc tested. Log titer reduction (LTR) values ranged from 0.3 to 2.0 logs for 20-48 hour challenges conducted in Water for Injection (WFI), and 3.8-7.1 logs for 6-hour challenges conducted in Minimal Media Davis (MMD). For 0.2 micron nylon 6.6 filter discs, penetration by R. pickettii was observed only in WFI challenges and was dependent on the culture and challenge conditions used. Penetration by R. pickettii was also restricted to only those membrane discs that were very close to the filter manufacturer's production integrity test (the Quantitative Bubble Point, QBP, test) limit. Where R. pickettii penetration was observed, LTR values were significantly higher than those observed for H. pseudoflava with the same filter discs. This study: 1) supports the use of H. pseudoflava as a worst-case challenge model for R. pickettii in process- and product-specific bacterial retention testing; 2) provides experimental evidence, for the first time, for the need to include filter membrane lots that have a physical integrity test value at or near the filter manufacturer's production (lower) limit in these tests; and 3) demonstrates how a standardized membrane integrity test (such as the QBP test) can be used select such \"worst-case\" membranes and to verify the inclusion of such \"worst-case\" membranes in these tests, thus serving as the link between the membrane disc used in bacterial retention validation testing and the production process filter.", "answer": "0.3 to 2.0 logs", "covered": false}

Within the last two decades, various vectors based on human viruses have been developed as gene transfer vehicles for gene therapy applications and vaccination. However, one yet unresolved problem connected to the use of viral vectors in humans is the pre-existing immunity to most of these vectors in the vast majority of the population which can result in impaired gene transfer efficiency and increased secondary toxicity. One approach to solve this problem is the development of recombinant viruses of non-human origin as vectors for gene transfer. The major rationale for using such vectors is the avoidance of vector neutralization by pre-existing antibodies directed against the virus on which the vector is based. Use of vectors based on non-human viruses may therefore allow the use of lower initial vector doses to achieve efficient gene transfer. Side-effects caused by interactions between vectors derived from human viruses with a primed immune system or with blood components could also be reduced. Furthermore, these vectors might show new cell type tropisms and could therefore infect tissue and organs that are not accessible to current viral vectors. This review outlines some of the problems inherent in the human origin of current viral vectors and describes features and progress with non-human adenovirus and baculovirus-derived vectors that may provide alternatives.", "answer": "Pre-existing immunity.", "covered": false}

In the first part of the study, blood samples to be analyzed for PIV 3 antibodies were collected from guinea pigs of a PIV 3-positive breeding colony at different times after birth. In the same breeding unit, 6 of 12 2-week-old guinea pigs were relocated and separately housed. The PIV 3 serum antibody titers of the two groups were compared at various times from birth to 13 weeks after birth. In the second part of the study, the spread of infectious virus and virus persistence were explored by housing seronegative sentinel animals together with 2- to 3-week-old guinea pigs from three different PIV 3-positive breeding units. The guinea pigs remaining in the breeding colony as well as those removed and housed separately showed declining serum antibody titers for about 1 month after birth, thereafter the titers were stable until about 8 weeks after birth. Five weeks later, the mean antibody titer of the guinea pigs remaining in the breeding colony had increased to a markedly higher level than that of the relocated, separately housed guinea pigs.

A mathematical model was used to examine the effects of a zigzag survey design on the adequacy of reconstructing patchy distribution fields. The model simulates fish or plankton patches (or gaps) of different shapes and spatial orientations, and an acoustic survey by a set of transects forming a zigzag. Adequacy of the reconstructed fields to those originally generated was evaluated by calculating their correlations (r). A priori information on the autocorrelation radius for the field in the direction of a survey (R) allows optimization of survey design and the algorithm of data analysis. A patchy field can be reconstructed properly (r &gt; 0.80) if the distance between transects D &lt; (1.0-1.5)R.

Helicobacter pylori colonization induces inflammation in essentially all hosts, a persistent process that increases the risk of developing distal gastric adenocarcinoma. However, only a small percentage of persons carrying H. pylori develop neoplasia; enhanced risk may be related to differences in expression of specific bacterial products, differences in the host response to the bacteria, or the interaction between host and microbe. H. pylori strains that have the cag pathogenicity island are associated with further increased risk for developing distal gastric cancer; however, host responses to H. pylori, such as altered epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, also may be important in lowering the threshold for carcinogenesis. H. pylori cag+ strains selectively enhance proliferation and attenuate apoptosis in human mucosa compared to cag- strains. However, cag+ strains also induce more severe gastritis, suggesting that host inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and hormones may modulate H. pylori-induced alterations in cellular turnover. In the Mongolian gerbil model of gastric carcinogenesis, apoptosis increases early and transiently following H. pylori infection, but scores progressively decline despite worsening gastric inflammation. Epithelial cell proliferation peaks later and is significantly related to increased gastrin levels, suggesting that epithelial cell growth in H. pylori-colonized mucosa may be mediated by gastrin-dependent mechanisms. An emerging model invoked by these data is one in which H. pylori cag+ strains, in conjunction with host mediators, enhance gastric epithelial cell proliferation but not apoptosis in vivo. The combination of increased proliferation without a concordant increase in apoptosis may therefore contribute to the heightened retention of mutagenized cells, which over decades may increase the subsequent risk for gastric cancer.", "answer": "The cag pathogenicity island in H. pylori strains contributes to the development of distal gastric cancer by enhancing epithelial cell proliferation without increasing apoptosis, leading to the retention of potentially mutated cells and increased cancer risk.", "covered": false}

With some of the earliest and most comprehensively evaluated vectors, such as retroviruses, advanced clinical trials were performed in tumor patients. Malignant primary brain tumors (gliomas) have been chosen for the first clinical studies on novel gene therapy approaches because these tumors are non-metastatic and develop on the largely postmitotic background of normal glial and neuronal tissue. However, the human cancer gene therapy studies performed so far were not as successful as preclinical animal experiments. Furthermore, the clinical studies did not address major limiting factors for in vivo gene therapy, such as insufficient gene transfer rates to the tumor with the used local delivery modalities, and the resulting inability of a particular transgene-prodrug system to confer permanently eradicating cytotoxicity to the whole neoplasm. Critical evaluation of gene transfer and therapy studies has led to the conclusion that, even using identical vectors, the anatomical route of vector administration can dramatically affect both the efficiency of tumor transduction and its spatial distribution, as well as the extent of intratumoral and intracerebral transgene expression. This review concentrates on different physical methods for vector delivery to malignant primary brain tumors in experimental or clinical settings: stereotactic or direct intratumoral injection or convection-enhanced bulk-flow interstitial delivery; intrathecal and intraventricular injection; and intravascular infusion with or without modification of the blood-tumor-barrier.

Previous work (Naigles, Fowler &amp; Helm, 1992, 1995; Naigles, Gleitman &amp; Gleitman, 1993) indicated that English-speaking two-year-olds faced with such ungrammatical sentences consistently altered the usual meaning of the verb to fit the syntactic frame (frame compliance) whereas adults faced with the same sentences altered the syntax to fit the meaning of the verb (verb compliance).

Blood lead concentration increased from 3.2 to 6.7 microg/dl with use of dominantly cast lead bullets in the outdoor range. In two intervals when no firing was undertaken for 3-4 months, the blood lead concentrations either decreased towards a baseline value in the case where only Cu-jacketed bullets were fired or remained elevated when dominantly cast lead bullets were fired. The propellants contained &lt;2 ppm Pb and contribute negligibly to blood lead. The isotopic composition of the primer used for all bullets was consistent with a source from the US. The bullets were of different materials and made in Australia and the US, with lead from sources of different geological age and hence different isotopic signatures. Variations in blood lead concentration and isotopic composition appear most strongly influenced by the bullets. Although more expensive, the use of Cu-jacketed bullets, non-lead primers and well-ventilated indoor firing ranges would lessen the health impacts of recreational shooting.", "answer": "Increased from 3.2 to 6.7 microg/dl.", "covered": false}

The chances of integration between an implant and the surrounding bone tissue depend on the surface characteristics of the implant itself.

Among various surfaces, calcium phosphate coatings seem to favour a rapid initial integration, but their dissolution by extracellular fluids raises some concern about the long-term stability at the bone-implant interface. Fluorinated apatites are known to be more stable than other ceramic coatings, but, at present, little is known on their effects on human cells. In this study, MG63 osteoblast-like cells were seeded onto two fluorohydroxyapatite (FHA)-coated titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) materials differing in roughness, respectively, LR-FHA (Ra = 5.6 microm) and HR-FHA (Ra = 21.2 microm). Quantification of the cells in contact with the FHA-coated materials by conventional methods involved some technical difficulties, on which we report. Only the indirect esteem by the measure of total content of proteins and a procedure based on cell count, following a double enzymatic treatment to detach the cells, offered plain results, indicating no significant differences between cellular growth in contact with test materials and with plastic control. Differentiation and functionality of the cells were comparatively evaluated by analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production.

Carrier testing for Tay-Sachs disease should be offered to couples when at least one individual is of Ashkenazi Jewish (carrier frequency 1/30), Pennsylvania Dutch, Southern Louisiana Cajun, or Eastern Quebec French Canadian descent. Ideally, testing is done prior to conception. For Ashkenazi Jews, in whom DNA testing identifies 99.9% of carriers, DNA testing is the preferred method to ascertain carriers [14]. For non-Jewish individuals seeking carrier testing, enzyme assay should be done initially and positive or indeterminate results should be confirmed by DNA mutation analysis. If only one partner is descended from a high-risk group, that person should be tested first; only if he/ she is a carrier should the other partner be tested. If the couple is pregnant at the time carrier testing is requested, both partners should have enzyme testing (leukocyte assay for the pregnant woman and serum assay for the father) and DNA testing sent concomitantly to expedite counseling and action. Carriers are individuals with a disease causing DNA mutation or carrier range enzyme analysis results on both serum and leukocytes with no detectable mutation and no pseudodeficiency alleles. Noncarriers are individuals with normal enzyme results or carrier range enzyme results and a pseudodeficiency allele on DNA mutation analysis.

Endovascular aneurysm surgery (EVAR) was introduced a decade ago. Early results are promising, however, there remain concerns regarding the longer-term durability of this technique. Consequently, the national multi-centre EVAR trial has been commenced to define the role of endovascular surgery in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Successful EVAR requires accurate pre-operative assessment of aneurysm morphology. Current stent-grafts allow 60% of all infra-renal AAA to be treated. Reduced physiological stress and low peri-operative morbidity and mortality rates have been demonstrated with this technique when compared to open repair. Endoleak is an Achilles heel of EVAR, although in itself does not accurately predict outcome. First and second generation devices are estimated to have a 1% per year risk of rupture. Increased understanding of the issues surrounding aneurysm morphology and successful stent-grafting have allowed a major reduction of early type I endoleak.

A polymorphism (C825T) in the gene encoding the G protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) has recently been associated with hypertension and obesity in several populations. The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between this polymorphism and insulin sensitivity, an hypothesised unifying factor for hypertension and obesity. One hundred thirty unrelated patients with essential hypertension, 70 female and 60 male, aged 58 +/- 1 years with systolic blood pressure of 173 +/- 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 105 +/- 1 mm Hg, were genotyped for the GNB3 polymorphism by PCR and restriction digestion with BseDI, and classified in two groups according to the genotypes CC and CT + TT.

On the contrary, there were no differences in the level of systolic or diastolic blood pressure among the genotypes. Insulin sensitivity was measured in a subgroup of 35 patients by means of an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. In this subgroup, patients with the T allele displayed lower insulin sensitivity index (1.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/min, p = 0.022), higher fasting serum insulin (121 +/- 16 vs. 77 +/- 11 pmol/L, p = 0.032), higher serum glucose 120 min after 75 g load (9.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, p = 0.038), and higher glycosilated haemoglobin (5.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.2%; p = 0.042) as compared with patients without the T allele.

Endotracheal intubation is the most effective method of securing the airway but is a complex skill requiring much practice. Traditionally, endotracheal intubation has been taught on patients, but this is not ideal. We have developed a short course on endotracheal intubation taught in a clinical simulation unit (CSU). This unit has a large range of airway trainers and patient simulators, some of which can be manipulated to make intubation more difficult.

Update on disease assessment. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a multisystem immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation of exocrine glands leading to clinical symptoms of dryness, particularly of the eyes and mouth which can be severe and disabling. It can occur in association with other rheumatic disorders or as a primary entity (PSS), often associated with B-cell hyperreactivity manifested by hypergammaglobulinaemia and anti-Ro and/or anti-La autoantibodies. These patients are more likely to have systemic involvement, for example of the pulmonary, neurological or haematological systems, and have a 44 times increased risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, this being the major adverse outcome in this disorder. Clinical trials of new therapies in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been advanced by the development of internationally agreed assessment and outcome measures such as the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR core datasets of disease activity in RA and measures of activity and damage in SLE such as BILAG, SLEDAI, SLICC etc. No such equivalent consensus exists for SS and as a result clinical trials have all used different, unvalidated, ad hoc measures of disease assessment and outcome. One attempt to bring a coherent approach to this issue is the \"Copenhagen model\" or disease assessment wheel that places each disease manifestation within specific categories depending on their presumed pathogenesis. Attempts have also been made to develop this into a severity tool by grading specific manifestations according to severity. In March 2000, interested specialists from around Europe met to develop a consensus on the broad principles underpinning disease assessment in SS (particularly PSS). It was agreed to adopt the international approach of dividing assessment into: exocrine and-nonexocrine disease activity (potentially reversible and including sicca symptoms and objective measures and systemic symptoms (particularly fatigue) and clinical features), damage (present for over 6 months), health-related and generic quality of life, and standard approaches to adverse events/toxicity and health economic aspects. The workshop also began the process of developing specific measures of sicca symptoms and systemic activity and damage.

The action of p53 as a tumor suppressor involves inhibition of cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Loss of p53 function therefore allows the uncontrolled proliferation associated with cancerous cells. While design of most anti-cancer agents has focused on targeting and inactivating cancer promoting targets, such as oncogenes, recent attention has been given to restoring the lost activity of tumor suppressor genes. Because the loss of p53 function is so prevalent in human cancer, this protein is an ideal candidate for such therapy. Several gene therapeutic strategies have been employed in the attempt to restore p53 function to cancerous cells. These approaches include introduction of wild-type p53 into cells with mutant p53; the use of small molecules to stabilize mutant p53 in a wild-type, active conformation; and the introduction of agents to prevent degradation of p53 by proteins that normally target it. In addition, because mutant p53 has oncogenic gain of function activity, several approaches have been investigated to selectively target and kill cells harboring mutant p53. These include the introduction of mutant viruses that cause cell death only in cells with mutant p53 and the introduction of a gene that, in the absence of functional p53, produces a toxic product.

Thus, a long retention interval may increase the subjective similarity between stimuli (the RIISS hypothesis), and this increase may produce forgetting. To examine this hypothesis, college students made speeded same-different discriminations between two lines or tones of different lengths or frequencies that were 400 ms or 3,300 ms apart, and they rated the similarity of these stimuli. The long interval produced poorer overall performance as expected, but also produced poorer performance on different than same stimuli, implying that it increased the subjective similarity between the initial and subsequent stimuli, and it also increased rated similarity, in support of the RIISS hypothesis.

The prevalence of childhood obesity is rising, and pediatric obesity has become an important public health issue. It can be defined as BMI more than 95th percentile for age and sex, whereas overweight is defined as BMI more than 85th percentile. Using these cut points, more than one quarter of all children and adolescents are either overweight or obese. The recent increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity result from the interaction between a strong genetic predisposition that facilitates storage of fat, easy access to calorically dense foods, and the low levels of physical activity that characterize modern societies. Childhood obesity has pervasive psychosocial and medical consequences in the short term and the long term. Many of these consequences may not be apparent for decades, but the metabolic complications of obesity and the insidious effects of early psychosocial stigmatization are sometimes observed even in young children. For pediatric obesity, behavioral approaches seem moderately efficacious in younger children. Comprehensive programs generally include modification of dietary and activity habits and some degree of parental involvement. Medication for pediatric obesity cannot be recommended currently outside the context of clinical trials.

This research investigated the oxygen-generating characteristics and side reactions of an electrolytic cell assembly that could be used to remediate sites with contaminants that are amenable to aerobic biodegradation. The oxygen-generating capabilities of new electrolytic cells and cells with light and heavy calcium carbonate precipitates on the cathode were evaluated in the laboratory under current densities ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mA/cm2. Higher current densities resulted in higher mass transfer coefficients (K(L)a) and greater saturation oxygen concentrations (Csat). As the cathodic deposits increased, the K(L)a tended to decrease and the Csat tended to increase. The oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) did not vary as a function of current density or cathode coating, while the average OTE for all the tests was 67%. Laboratory column tests showed that chlorine production increased with current density and depended on chloride levels in the water. Hydrogen peroxide was generated at low concentrations (&lt; 1 mg/L) and at higher levels when chloride was absent in the feed solution. Calcium removal from solution increased with current density and resulted in a decrease in solution pH. Tests at a field monitoring well showed average Csat levels of 16.9 mg/L after 14 days of operation, no chlorine production because of low chloride levels in the well, artificially elevated hydrogen peroxide levels because of background interferences, and a pH decrease of 2.4 units.

L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLME) prevents GVHD in several animal models by depleting dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI)-expressing cytotoxic cellular subsets. However, clinical application has been hampered by difficulties in stem cell engraftment following treatment of donor bone marrow inocula with LLME at the concentrations necessary to purge DPPI-expressing T-cells. Noting that T-cells can mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses via both perforin (usually co-expressed in cytotoxic granules with DPPI) and Fas ligand pathways in a murine model, we hypothesized that LLME might be useful for treatment of delayed DLIs for potential GVL activity with a decreased risk of GVHD induction. In regard to the clinical setting, the ex vivo use of LLME for this purpose would circumvent any toxicity issues for donor stem cells, because by that time patients would have already achieved successful engraftment. For our preclinical studies, we used the haploidentical C57BL/6 (B6) (H2b) --&gt; ((B6 x DBA/2)F1 (H(2b/d)) murine model with lethally irradiated hosts that had received transplants of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells and were challenged with the MMD2-8 myeloid leukemia line (H2d) of DBA/2 origin. A DLI of LLME-treated donor splenocytes, from B6 mice presensitized to recipient alloantigens, was administered in varying doses 14 days post-marrow transplantation, and the potential for both GVHD and GVL activity was assessed. All mice that received any dose of LLME-treated DLI survived indefinitely, without evidence of cachexia nor B-cell hypoplasia, in contrast to the severe and lethal GVHD induced by mock-treated DLI. Histological analysis largely correlated with the symptomatic findings and revealed no GVHD-like lesions in the spleens of LLME-treated DLI recipients, although some mice displayed various degrees of hepatic mononuclear infiltration. Most notably, mice given LLME-treated DLI also experienced DLI dose-dependent increases in survival against the challenge with the MMD2-8 leukemia. LLME-treated splenocytes remained immunocompetent, as these cells could proliferate in response to mitogens and to restimulation with ovalbumin when used as a recall antigen.

The paper focuses on those aspects of literacy competence that are expressed in language as well as aspects of linguistic knowledge that are affected by literacy competence, tracing the route that children take in appropriating linguistic literacy as part of their cognitive abilities and examining the effect of literacy on language across development. Our view of linguistic literacy consists of one defining feature: control over linguistic variation from both a user-dependent ('lectal') and a context-dependent (modality, genre, and register) perspective; of one concomitant process: metalanguage and its role in language development; and of one condition: familiarity with writing and written language from two aspects: written language as discourse style--the recognition that the kind of language used for writing is essentially different from the one used for speech; and written language as a notational system--the perception and growing command of the representational system that is used in the written modality.

The long-term goal of this research is to develop and validate an in vivo reptile model for endocrine-mediated toxicity using fence lizards (Sceloporus spp.). One of the best defined estrogenic responses in oviparous vertebrates is induction of the yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin (Vtg). In this study, dose-response and time course relationships for Vtg induction were determined in male western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) given intraperitoneal injections of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Plasma Vtg was quantified directly with an antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirectly using plasma alkaline-labile phosphate (ALP) in order to compare these two methods. Both ELISA and ALP predicted similar median effective dose (ED50 [dose causing a 50% maximal response]) values for plasma Vtg induction (0.167 mg/kg for ELISA and 0.095 mg/kg for ALP). In addition, both ELISA and ALP detected significant Vtg induction at a dose of 0.0003 mg/kg of EE2, which was the lowest dose used in our study. A decrease in body weight at the highest dose (10 mg/kg) and an increase in hepatosomatic index at the four highest doses were observed.

{"id": "pubmed23n0400_1084_1", "question": "How can choosing monotherapy over combination therapy help reduce costs in treating CAP?", "doc_chunk": "Cost-effective approaches to the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the era of resistance. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) infects upwards of four million people in the US each year, of which 20% require subsequent hospitalisation. Consequently, it is a large contributor to excessive healthcare resource consumption and cost. Since the aetiology of CAP is not identified in a majority of patients, treatment is often empiric, aimed at the most common causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and the atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila). A variety of pharmaceutical agents exist for the treatment of CAP, most notably the cephalosporin and penicillin derivatives, the macrolide/azalide antibacterials, the newer tetracyclines, and most recently the respiratory fluoroquinolones. Choosing an agent is usually related to issues such as patient compliance, adverse event profiles, and the presence of resistance. Of these, resistance seems to be the main factor today. S. pneumoniae, the most common cause of CAP, is steadily acquiring resistance to a majority of the currently available antibacterials, thus further increasing costs due to prolonged hospitalisation, treatment of relapses and the use of more expensive antibacterials. Understanding and maximising the pharmacodynamic properties of the available antibacterials will not only prevent the emergence of resistance, thus prolonging their clinical utility, but also reduce the costs associated with treating the infection through rapid symptom improvement and earlier patient discharge. Numerous methods for reducing costs in patients with bacterial infections are documented in the literature and can be applied to CAP. Choosing monotherapy instead of combination therapy can reduce costs associated with the administration of the antibacterial. Agents with longer half-lives allow for once-daily administration, which in turn, leads to improved compliance, successful outcomes, and decreased costs. Administering antibacterials to maximise their pharmacodynamics, such as with continuous infusion of beta-lactams, reduces the amount of drug needed in addition to savings associated with administration and supplies. Finally, transitioning patients to oral therapy as soon as they are clinically stable can significantly reduce the length of hospital stay, which is the major contributing factor of healthcare costs. The use of a clinical pathway in an institution is the most effective way to apply these cost-saving approaches in the treatment of CAP. These pathways should be specific to each institution, thus considering the resistance rates in the area and encouraging the use of the most active, cost-effective agents to produce rapid, positive clinical outcomes.", "answer": "Choosing monotherapy reduces costs associated with the administration of multiple antibacterial agents.", "covered": false}

A series of N(6)-alkyl-2-alkynyl derivatives of adenosine (Ado) have been synthesized and evaluated for their affinity at human A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors and for their potency at A(2B) adenosine receptor subtypes. The corresponding 2-(1-alkynyl) derivatives of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and Ado are used as reference compounds. Binding studies demonstrated that the activities of 2-alkynylAdos were slightly increased for the adenosine A(1) receptor and slightly decreased for both A(3) and A(2B) subtypes compared to those of their corresponding NECA derivatives, whereas the A(2A) receptor affinities of the two series of nucleosides were similar. The presence of a methyl group on N(6) of the 2-alkynyladenosines, inducing an increase in affinity at the human A(3) receptor and a decrease at the other subtypes, resulted in an increase in A(3) selectivity. In particular, 2-phenylethynyl-N(6)-methylAdo (8b) showed an A(3) affinity in the low nanomolar range (K(i)(A(3)) = 3.4 nM), with a A(1)/A(3) and A(2A)/A(3) selectivity of about 500 and 2500, respectively. These findings motivated us to search for the preparation of new selective radioligands for the A(3) subtype; hence, a procedure to introduce a tritiated alkylamino group in these molecules was carried out. As far as the potency at the A(2B) receptor, the type of 2-alkynyl chain and the presence of the ethylcarboxamido group on the sugar seem to be very important; in fact, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynylNECA [(S)-PHPNECA, 1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM] proved to be one of the most potent A(2B) agonist reported so far.

Muscle is a convenient and accessible site for non-viral gene delivery, which can manufacture gene products and provide a long-duration of gene expression. The level of gene expression after administration of naked DNA plasmid or polymer-formulated DNA plasmid containing a reporter gene to muscle via syringe injection, however, is very low. As a result, no significant therapeutic effect can be detected after saline- or polymer-mediated gene delivery into muscle. In 1998, investigators published a striking new approach--electrotransfection--for intramuscular gene delivery (now commonly referred to as electroporation or electroinjection). Electroporation of a non-viral gene into the muscles of small animals has increased the level of gene expression by as much as two orders of magnitude, which is comparable to levels achieved with adenoviral gene delivery. Three years later, intramuscular electroporation gene delivery technology has blossomed. Treatments for different diseases using this approach in animal models have been reported.

Triclosan (TCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy]-phenol) is a widely used antimicrobial agent. To understand its fate during sewage treatment, the biodegradation and removal of TCS were determined in activated sludge. In addition, the effects of TCS on treatment processes were assessed. Fate was determined by examining the biodegradation and removal of TCS radiolabeled with 14C in the 2,4-dichlorphenoxy ring in laboratory batch mineralization experiments and bench-top continuous activated-sludge (CAS) systems. In batch experiments with unacclimated sludge, TCS was mineralized to 14CO2, but the total yield varied as a function of test concentration. Systems that were redosed with TCS exhibited more extensive and faster mineralization, indicating that adaptation was a critical factor determining the rate and extent of biodegradation. In a CAS study in which the influent level of TCS was incrementally increased from 40 microg/L to 2,000 microg/L, removal of the parent compound exceeded 98.5% and removal of total radioactivity (parent and metabolites) exceeded 85%. Between 1.5 and 4.5% of TCS in the influent was sorbed to the wasted solids, whereas &gt;94% underwent primary biodegradation and 81 to 92% was mineralized to CO2 or incorporated in biomass. Increasing levels of TCS in the influent had no major adverse effects on any wastewater treatment process, including chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, and ammonia removal. In a subsequent experiment, a CAS system, acclimated to TCS at 35 microg/L, received two separate 4-h shock loads of 750 microg/L TCS. Neither removal of TCS nor treatment processes exhibited major adverse effects. An additional CAS study was conducted to examine the removal of a low level (10 microg/L) of TCS. Removal of parent equaled 94.7%, and biodegradation remained the dominant removal mechanism. A subsequent series of CAS experiments examined removal at four influent concentrations (7.5, 11, 20, and 50 microg/L) of TCS and demonstrated that removal of parent ranged from 98.2 to 99.3% and was independent of concentration. Although TCS removal across all experiments appeared unrelated to influent concentration, removal was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.87) with chemical oxygen demand removal, indicating that TCS removal was related to overall treatment efficiency of specific CAS units. In conclusion, the experiments show that TCS is extensively biodegraded and removed in activated-sludge systems and is unlikely to upset sewage treatment processes at levels expected in household and manufacturing wastewaters.", "answer": ">94%", "covered": false}

We tested a computer-based procedure for assessing reader strategies that was based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis (LSA). Students were given self-explanation-reading training (SERT), which teaches strategies that facilitate self-explanation during reading, such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences. During a computerized version of SERT practice, students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. The similarity between human judgments and LSA indicates that LSA will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a Web-based version of SERT.", "answer": "Self-explanation-reading training (SERT).", "covered": false}

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease that afflicts up to 1 in 2,500 people in the western world. Since 1989, when mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene were identified as responsible for the disease, intense effort has been applied to the development of replacement gene therapy strategies to cure CF. Problems with basic gene delivery techniques along with limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of CF have hindered progress so far. However, recent insights into the expression patterns and functions of CFTR in developing and adult lungs are now advancing our understanding of this disease. It is becoming apparent that progress in gene delivery to cure CF may be best served by identification of a target cell(s) around which gene transfer strategies can be specifically tailored to most closely reproduce the effects of normal CFTR expression. In fact, accurate restoration of endogenous expression patterns may be crucial, not only for disease reversal, but also to avoid potentially deleterious effects of inappropriate expression. This approach is in turn confounded however, by ill-defined stem and progenitor cell pathways within the lung epithelium. Nonetheless, studies to date suggest that these pathways are relatively plastic and may respond differently during homeostasis compared with repair following injury. It may therefore be feasible to target the lung epithelium in a non-cell specific manner and allow endogenous differentiation pathways to subsequently establish correct CFTR distribution patterns. In this review, emerging information on CFTR expression and function in developing and adult lungs is discussed in the context of putative stem cell populations and their potential for current gene delivery approaches.", "answer": "Progress in gene therapy for CF has been hindered by challenges in gene delivery techniques and limited understanding of CF pathogenesis.", "covered": false}

A prime assumption of this equation is that when partially ionised eluents are used (such as benzoic acid), both the ionised and neutral components of the eluent species contribute to the detector response of anionic analytes. Experimental evidence is provided to support this assumption in that pH changes accompanying the elution of an analyte have been measured.

Auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) has been developed in order to benefit from the efficacy of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), but to avoid the negative counterpart of OLT which is to eliminate the possibility of native liver (NL) regeneration and which consequently implies a life-long immunosuppression. In our institution we performed 16 consecutive APOLTs in 15 patients between October 1992 and December 1999. Patients' mean age was 30 years (range 0.5-65 years). The causes of FHF were viral (HAV = 3; HBV = 3), drugs (n = 4), or others (n = 5). None of the patients had a history of chronic liver disease. The decision to transplant was taken when the patients met well-defined criteria. All but one of the patients were in a coma. Five patients died, 10 patients are alive (66.7%). Regeneration of the NL occurred in 11 of the 15 patients (73.3%) and in 8 of the 10 survivors. Six of these 8 patients have permanently stopped immunosuppressive therapy. These results can be favorably compared with those of OLT for FHF. In the European Transplant Registry, the survival rate is 57% at 5 years (2612 patients receiving OLT for FHF between 1988 and 1998). In our experience the survival rate is 59% at 5 years (42 patients receiving OLT for FHF between 1987 and 1999). APOLT is feasible in both adults and children; it rapidly restored liver function and reversed encephalopathy. Right APOLT seems more advisable since the right liver provides more functional hepatocytes; however, left APOLT harvested in an adult appears sufficient for a child. APOLT should be proposed only to patients with high chances of liver regeneration: age of recipient, etiology of liver failure, interval between onset of jaundice and occurrence of encephalopathy, and quality of liver graft are early prognostic indicators.

Sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) was first launched in the US in 1997 as an aid to smoking cessation and has since been launched in many other countries. Adverse events associated with the use of bupropion SR at the recommended dosage of 150mg twice daily in clinical trials most commonly included insomnia, headache, dry mouth, nausea and anxiety; insomnia and anxiety are also recognised as symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Only insomnia and dry mouth occurred significantly more frequently with bupropion SR than with placebo. Relative to placebo, no significant changes in mean values for heart rate, blood pressure or routine laboratory parameters have been reported in smokers using bupropion SR alone in clinical trials. When bupropion SR was compared with a nicotine transdermal patch in a clinical trial, insomnia predominated in the bupropion SR group, while dream abnormalities were more common in smokers using the nicotine patch. Bupropion SR and the nicotine transdermal patch in combination can be used safely (with appropriate monitoring) as an aid to smoking cessation. Infrequent but clinically important adverse reactions to bupropion SR include seizures and hypersensitivity reactions: in controlled clinical trials of bupropion SR (300 mg/day), where smokers were carefully screened for risk factors for seizure, the incidence of both seizures and severe hypersensitivity reactions was approximately 0.1% for each event. In order to avoid a risk of seizure of greater than 0.1%, smokers should be screened for predisposing risk factors and adhere to the manufacturer's dosage recommendations (maximum daily dose of 300mg). Thus, bupropion SR is generally well tolerated, as seen by the low discontinuation rate due to an adverse event in clinical trials (6 to 12%).

The majority of prion diseases does not appear to be caused by transmission of an infectious agent but occur spontaneously with no known cause. The strongest supporting evidence that the prion protein is the causative agent in prion disease comes from specific inheritable forms of prion disease which are linked to single point mutations in the prion protein gene. Paradoxically, these point mutations, although autosomal dominant with 100% penetrance do not lead to disease until late in life.

Based on the origin of the anorectal fistula development from cryptoglandular abscesses, the internal opening of most fistulas is located at the dentate line. The type of fistula is most commonly diagnosed at an anorectal examination under anesthesia, where anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy can be performed at the time of fistula tract exploration. The decision of which structures the fistula connection incorporates, i.e., internal and external sphincter complex is important as only a small amount of external sphincter muscle that can be cut. [7] Up to 30% of the external sphincter muscle can be cut without compromising fecal continence. To avoid the cutting of too much external sphincter and to decrease the risk of fecal incontinence as well as to allow adequate drainage following abscess drainage, a Seton can be placed through the tract. Seton can either be utilized to slowly cut through the sphincter muscle over time, called 'cutting Seton.' Setons can also be placed into fistula tracks to allow previously undrained collections to heal around the seton slowly, called a 'non-cutting Seton.' In addition to the depth of the fistula, there are certain clues as to where the fistula tract originates from the location of the external opening. This is from Goodsall's rule, which states that if a transverse line is drawn across the anus, a fistulous external opening which is anterior to this line and will be located internally 3 cm of the anal verge, with the fistulas tract radially and directly into the anal canal. However, if the external opening is posterior to this line or outside of the 3 to 4 cm area from the anal verge, then these fistulas tend to arc around to the posterior midline anal gland. These arching fistula tracts are sometimes difficult to completely discern at the first operation, so the tract can be partially unroofed towards to anal verge being careful to avoid the destruction of the external anal sphincter. Although Goodsall's rule has been taught for years, there are some challenges to this rule recently; however, for simple fistulas, it is a good starting point.

Previous study has demonstrated that brushite (CaHPO4 x 2H2O), modified by partial potassium substitution for calcium, can transform quickly into hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca5(PO4)3OH) when exposed to aqueous salt solutions at room temperature. Analyses techniques used in those studies required sample retrieval from solution, which may alter the sample surface. In this work FTIR/ ATR was used in analysis, enabling in situ study of the transformation within the aqueous environment. To test the biocompatibility of this brushite, cellular response to the transformation needs to be understood. Cellular response was initiated by bovine serum albumin adsorption on the brushite surface. The response was studied by monitoring the conformation of the adsorbed protein, which is critical to cellular reaction. This required monitoring the brushite transformation and surface adsorbed protein conformation simultaneously which can be realized using FTIR/ATR.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease that afflicts up to 1 in 2,500 people in the western world. Since 1989, when mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene were identified as responsible for the disease, intense effort has been applied to the development of replacement gene therapy strategies to cure CF. Problems with basic gene delivery techniques along with limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of CF have hindered progress so far. However, recent insights into the expression patterns and functions of CFTR in developing and adult lungs are now advancing our understanding of this disease. It is becoming apparent that progress in gene delivery to cure CF may be best served by identification of a target cell(s) around which gene transfer strategies can be specifically tailored to most closely reproduce the effects of normal CFTR expression. In fact, accurate restoration of endogenous expression patterns may be crucial, not only for disease reversal, but also to avoid potentially deleterious effects of inappropriate expression. This approach is in turn confounded however, by ill-defined stem and progenitor cell pathways within the lung epithelium. Nonetheless, studies to date suggest that these pathways are relatively plastic and may respond differently during homeostasis compared with repair following injury. It may therefore be feasible to target the lung epithelium in a non-cell specific manner and allow endogenous differentiation pathways to subsequently establish correct CFTR distribution patterns. In this review, emerging information on CFTR expression and function in developing and adult lungs is discussed in the context of putative stem cell populations and their potential for current gene delivery approaches.", "answer": "Targeting specific cells in the lung epithelium could improve gene transfer strategies for CF treatment by enabling more precise restoration of CFTR function and avoiding deleterious effects of inappropriate expression.", "covered": false}

There is presently a substantial amount of information being gathered concerning the environmental risk associated with the perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) compound. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is requiring that more research be completed before making definitive decisions concerning the regulatory issues covered in the significant new use rule (18/10-2000) under the Toxic Substance Control Act. However, there are no risk assessment requirements under seminatural conditions in microcosms. The PFOS can enter, and has been found in, the aquatic environment through different pathways, including spills associated with use of fire-fighting foams containing PFOS, leaching from washing Scotchgard-treated clothes with the wastewater, leaching from various coatings, discharges as residual waste from fluorochemical production, or volatilization and transportation atmospherically. The biota is the sink of PFOS rather than the sediment or soil. The aim of this article is to determine a 35-d community no-observable-effect concentration (NOECcommunity) for freshwater zooplankton and the fate of PFOS during the course of study. The PFOS persisted in the water phase with only slight reductions over the study; only the decrease from 33.9 mg/L at day 1 to 29.8 mg/L at day 35 was significant. A 90 to 100% reduction (p &lt; 0.01) of the total zooplankton population was found after one week of exposure to 30 mg PFOS/L and a similar reduction after two weeks at 10 mg PFOS/L.

The action of p53 as a tumor suppressor involves inhibition of cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Loss of p53 function therefore allows the uncontrolled proliferation associated with cancerous cells. While design of most anti-cancer agents has focused on targeting and inactivating cancer promoting targets, such as oncogenes, recent attention has been given to restoring the lost activity of tumor suppressor genes. Because the loss of p53 function is so prevalent in human cancer, this protein is an ideal candidate for such therapy. Several gene therapeutic strategies have been employed in the attempt to restore p53 function to cancerous cells. These approaches include introduction of wild-type p53 into cells with mutant p53; the use of small molecules to stabilize mutant p53 in a wild-type, active conformation; and the introduction of agents to prevent degradation of p53 by proteins that normally target it. In addition, because mutant p53 has oncogenic gain of function activity, several approaches have been investigated to selectively target and kill cells harboring mutant p53. These include the introduction of mutant viruses that cause cell death only in cells with mutant p53 and the introduction of a gene that, in the absence of functional p53, produces a toxic product. Many obstacles remain to optimize these strategies for use in humans, but, despite these, restoration of p53 function is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic approach.", "answer": "p53 mutation leads to loss of tumor suppressor function, enabling uncontrolled cell proliferation typical in cancer.", "covered": false}

This study attempted to determine the feasibility and utility of methods used in evidence-based medicine for some common questions in the practice of occupational medicine. The following clinical questions were generated that were representative of the type of problems encountered by occupational health physicians: is work a cause of health problems and is impaired health a cause of diminished work capacity for a specific job? Answers were generated according to the method used in evidence-based medicine by formulating an answerable question, searching the literature, critically appraising the results, and applying the results to the clinical question. Answers were found to all the questions in a reasonable amount of time. The searches revealed a need for more systematic reviews and studies that use work-related health outcomes like return to work. However, there is more evidence available in Medline than is generally assumed by occupational health physicians. Using this evidence led to better clinical decisions. Pitfalls during the literature search were typing mistakes, problems in using medical subject headings, and unreliable search strategies. With the use of the abstracts only, most clinical questions could be answered satisfactorily, but concrete risk estimates were often lacking. The lack of availability of full text journals decreased the reliability of the critical appraisal and risk estimation.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is usually regarded as one of the most serious side-effects of the long-term usage of neuroleptics due to its high prevalence and potentially irreversible nature. Previously, several genetic polymorphisms were investigated for an association with TD in various ethnic populations. Among them, the Ser9Gly variant in the MscI restriction site of the dopamine D3 receptor gene was reported to be associated with TD. We have investigated the association of Ser9Gly polymorphism of the dopamine D3 receptor gene with TD in Korean schizophrenics. The frequencies of the genotypes of Ser/Ser, Ser/Gly and Gly/Gly in 54 schizophrenic patients without TD were 21 (38.9%), 33 (61.1%) and 0 (0%), while the corresponding frequencies in 59 schizophrenic patients with TD were 25 (42.4%), 28 (47.5%) and 6 (10.1%). We have found a significant genotypic association of the Gly/Gly genotype with TD in Korean schizophrenics (P = 0.028, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). However, there was no significant allelic association of the Ser9Gly allele with TD (chi2 = 0.288, d.f. = 1, P = 0.591) and there was no significant difference in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale score between the three genotypic groups (P = 0.071, anova). In conclusion, we suggest that Gly/Gly homozygotes in the MscI polymorphic site of the dopamine D3 receptor gene may cause some change in the function of the dopamine D3 receptor and may be involved the pathogenesis of TD.", "answer": "The Ser9Gly polymorphism in the dopamine D3 receptor gene is significantly associated with tardive dyskinesia in Korean schizophrenics, specifically the Gly/Gly genotype.", "covered": false}

We evaluated 71 muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) of the bladder by tumor compartments. Kinetic parameters included mitotic figure counting, Ki-67 index, proliferation rate (DNA slide cytometry), and apoptotic index (in situ end labeling [ISEL] of fragmented DNA using digoxigenin-labeled deoxyuridine triphosphate and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase [Klenow fragment]). At least 50 high-power fields per compartment were screened from the same tumor areas; results are expressed as percentage of positive neoplastic cells. Mean and SD were compared by tumor compartment. DNA was extracted from microdissected samples (superficial and deep) and used for microsatellite analysis of TP53 and NF1 by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Significantly higher marker scores were revealed in the superficial compartment than in the deep compartment. An ISEL index of less than 1% was revealed in 63% (45/71) of superficial compartments and 86% (61/71) of deep compartments. Isolated NF1 alterations were observed mainly in superficial compartments, whereas isolated TP53 abnormalities were present in deep compartments.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_760_0", "question": "What factors play a role in forming the domes within the diaphragm's structure?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The domes are produced by: the liver on the right, with some contribution from the right kidney and the right suprarenal gland, and the fundus of the stomach and spleen on the left, with contributions from the left kidney and the left suprarenal gland. Although the height of these domes varies during breathing, a reasonable estimate in normal expiration places the left dome at the fifth intercostal space and the right dome at rib V. This is important to remember when percussing the thorax. During inspiration, the muscular part of the diaphragm contracts, causing the central tendon of the diaphragm to be drawn inferiorly. This results in some flattening of the domes, enlargement of the thoracic cavity, and a reduction in intrathoracic pressure. The physiological effect of these changes is that air enters the lungs and venous return to the heart is enhanced. There is blood supply to the diaphragm on its superior and inferior surfaces:", "answer": "The production of the domes in the anatomy of the diaphragm is contributed by the liver, right kidney, and right suprarenal gland on the right side, and the fundus of the stomach, spleen, left kidney, and left suprarenal gland on the left side.", "covered": true}
{"id": "pubmed23n0400_391_2", "question": "How does the anatomical route of vector administration impact the efficiency of tumor transduction in gene therapy studies?", "doc_chunk": "Vector delivery methods and targeting strategies for gene therapy of brain tumors. Efficient virus and non-virus vector systems for gene transfer to tumor cells have been developed and tested in cell culture and in animal experiments. With some of the earliest and most comprehensively evaluated vectors, such as retroviruses, advanced clinical trials were performed in tumor patients. Malignant primary brain tumors (gliomas) have been chosen for the first clinical studies on novel gene therapy approaches because these tumors are non-metastatic and develop on the largely postmitotic background of normal glial and neuronal tissue. However, the human cancer gene therapy studies performed so far were not as successful as preclinical animal experiments. Furthermore, the clinical studies did not address major limiting factors for in vivo gene therapy, such as insufficient gene transfer rates to the tumor with the used local delivery modalities, and the resulting inability of a particular transgene-prodrug system to confer permanently eradicating cytotoxicity to the whole neoplasm. Critical evaluation of gene transfer and therapy studies has led to the conclusion that, even using identical vectors, the anatomical route of vector administration can dramatically affect both the efficiency of tumor transduction and its spatial distribution, as well as the extent of intratumoral and intracerebral transgene expression. This review concentrates on different physical methods for vector delivery to malignant primary brain tumors in experimental or clinical settings: stereotactic or direct intratumoral injection or convection-enhanced bulk-flow interstitial delivery; intrathecal and intraventricular injection; and intravascular infusion with or without modification of the blood-tumor-barrier. The advantages and drawbacks of the different modes and delivery routes of in vivo vector application, and the possibilities for tumor targeting by modifications of the native tropism of virus vectors or by using tissue-specific or inducible transgene expression are summarized.", "answer": "The anatomical route of vector administration dramatically affects the efficiency of tumor transduction.", "covered": false}
