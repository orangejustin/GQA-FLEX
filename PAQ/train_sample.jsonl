{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_141_1", "question": "What is the anatomical term for the space containing the dura mater in the vertebral canal?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. In the vertebral canal, the dura mater is separated from surrounding bone by an extradural (epidural) space containing loose connective tissue, fat, and a venous plexus. The 31 pairs of spinal nerves are segmental in distribution and emerge from the vertebral canal between the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves (C1 to C8), twelve thoracic (T1 to T12), five lumbar (L1 to L5), five sacral (S1 to S5), and one coccygeal (Co). Each nerve is attached to the spinal cord by a posterior root and an anterior root (Fig. 2.9). After exiting the vertebral canal, each spinal nerve branches into: a posterior ramus—collectively, the small posterior rami innervate the back; and an anterior ramus—the much larger anterior rami innervate most other regions of the body except the head, which is innervated predominantly, but not exclusively, by cranial nerves.", "answer": "extradural space"}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_540_0", "question": "What is the term used when the ductus arteriosus fails to close at birth?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Occasionally, the ductus arteriosus, which connects the left branch of the pulmonary artery to the inferior aspect of the aortic arch, fails to close at birth. This is termed a patent or persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

Guanylyl cyclase plays an important role in cardiac muscle relaxation. ANP and BNP are produced and released by cardiac muscle when there is an increase in myocardial wall stretch and/or pressure and an increase in catecholamines, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin 2, endothelin, and glucocorticoids. ANP and BNP are natriuretic peptides that bind to membrane-associated guanylyl cyclase receptors (NPRs). Of the seven mammalian membrane-associated guanylyl cyclases, the NPR-A and NPR-B participate in natriuretic peptide pathways. ANP and BNP activate NPR-A to regulate body volume homeostasis, blood pressure, and local anti-hypertrophic effects in the myocardium.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_37_1", "question": "How is cartilage nourished and what is its vascularization like?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. There are three types of cartilage: hyaline—most common; matrix contains a moderate amount of collagen fibers (e.g., articular surfaces of bones); elastic—matrix contains collagen fibers along with a large number of elastic fibers (e.g., external ear); fibrocartilage—matrix contains a limited number of cells and ground substance amidst a substantial amount of collagen fibers (e.g., intervertebral discs). Cartilage is nourished by diffusion and has no blood vessels, lymphatics, or nerves. Bone is a calcified, living, connective tissue that forms the majority of the skeleton. It consists of an intercellular calcified matrix, which also contains collagen fibers, and several types of cells within the matrix. Bones function as: supportive structures for the body, protectors of vital organs, reservoirs of calcium and phosphorus, levers on which muscles act to produce movement, and containers for blood-producing cells.", "answer": "Cartilage is nourished by diffusion and lacks vascularization, meaning it has no blood vessels, lymphatics, or nerves."}

{"id": "article-21960_17_0", "question": "What are the contraindications for using the fibular free flap for bony reconstructions?", "doc_chunk": "Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Flap -- Contraindications. The size and quality of the bone harvested are also significant limiting factors in the use of this flap. Reconstructions that require more than 10 to 12 cm of bone, such as a total mandibulectomy, cannot be reconstructed with a single OCRFFF. The thickness of the bone is also limited. Under optimal conditions, the fibular free flap is preferred for bony reconstructions. It offers many of the same qualities the OCRFFF does; it is pliable, thin, and has a long pedicle. It has the added advantage, however, of greater bone stock thickness, and most lower extremity weight-bearing is on the tibia, not the fibula. The fibular free flap similarly requires that blood flow to the distal extremity (i.e., the foot) be sufficient after the loss of the contribution of the peroneal artery. This might not be a major issue in a young trauma patient needing osseous free flap reconstruction. However, head and neck cancer patients, who may have smoking-related vasculopathy, be of older age, and may have other medical comorbidities, may have insufficient blood flow to the distal extremity (or through the peroneal artery) to support the fibular flap as a viable reconstruction option. It is not uncommon for a vascular study to contraindicate the use of the fibular flap, leaving the osteocutaneous radial forearm, scapular/parascapular flaps, or iliac crest flap as the next option. Each of these reconstructive options has advantages and disadvantages associated with it.", "answer": "Insufficient blood flow to the distal extremity, particularly due to conditions like smoking-related vasculopathy, older age, or other medical comorbidities."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_591_0", "question": "What is the main cause of the thick and sticky secretions in cystic fibrosis?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the function of exocrine glands due to a gene mutation, leading to an abnormally low concentration of chloride in exocrine secretions, rendering them thick and sticky. Thick secretions cause blockage and subsequent damage to the airways, bowel, pancreas, liver, and reproductive tract. In the lungs, thick nonclearing secretions lead to recurrent infections and persistent inflammation, resulting in permanent distortion and dilation of the distal bronchi, a condition known as bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis can be seen on plain chest radiographs as tubular (tram track like) structures, particularly affecting the upper lobes. Computed tomography can easily demonstrate the extent of airway damage and identify potential pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis such as lobar collapse, pneumothorax, or enlargement of the pulmonary trunk due to pulmonary hypertension.", "answer": "The main cause of the thick and sticky secretions in cystic fibrosis is the abnormally low concentration of chloride in exocrine secretions due to a gene mutation."}

{"id": "article-23268_5_2", "question": "What is the difference between primary and secondary hypogonadism?", "doc_chunk": "Hypogonadism -- Pathophysiology. Testosterone production by testicular Leydig cells depends on stimulation from the anterior pituitary gland which secretes pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) into the circulation. When LH binds to its receptors on Leydig cells, it causes cAMP levels to rise. Increased levels of cAMP drives the expression of two proteins: StAR (the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and CYP11A1 (the cholesterol sidechain clevage enzyme). StAR promotes the transfer of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane while CYP11A1 promotes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. Pregnenolone can undergo 17 alpha-hydroxylation to 17 OH pregnenolone which is converted to DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone [8] . DHEA is then converted into androstenediol in order to make testosterone.  Primary hypogonadism is when the testicular steroidogenesis is insufficient to synthesis adequate levels of testosterone while secondary hypogonadism is when signaling to the testis (either from the pituitary, through LH, or from the hypothalamus, through GnRH) is unable to stimulate sufficient Leydig cell testosterone production.", "answer": "Primary hypogonadism is characterized by a direct failure of the testes to produce sufficient testosterone due to issues in steroidogenesis.

Transmission of dengue generally follows two patterns - epidemic dengue and hyperendemic dengue. When a single strain of DENV is responsible for introduction and transmission it is referred to as epidemic dengue. Dengue epidemics were more common prior to World War II. During an epidemic, all age groups are affected, but the incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever is relatively low. Hyperendemicity refers to the co-circulation of various serotypes of DENV in a community. Periodic epidemics in an area are linked to the emergence of hyperendemicity. [9] Children are affected more than adults, and the incidence of DHF is relatively higher.", "answer": "Hyperendemicity involves the co-circulation of various serotypes of DENV, whereas epidemic dengue typically involves a single strain of DENV."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_911_1", "question": "What causes jaundice in patients with liver disorders?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The liver is responsible for the production of numerous proteins, including those of the clotting cascade. Any disorder of the liver (including infection and cirrhosis) may decrease the production of these proteins and so prevent adequate blood clotting. Patients with severe cirrhosis of the liver have a significant risk of serious bleeding, even from small cuts; in addition, when varices rupture, there is a danger of rapid exsanguination. As the liver progressively fails, the patient develops salt and water retention, which produces skin and subcutaneous edema. Fluid (ascites) is also retained in the peritoneal cavity, which can hold many liters. The poorly functioning liver cells (hepatocytes) are unable to break down blood and blood products, leading to an increase in the serum bilirubin level, which manifests as jaundice.", "answer": "Jaundice in patients with liver disorders is caused by the inability of poorly functioning liver cells (hepatocytes) to break down blood and blood products, leading to an increase in serum bilirubin levels."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_739_2", "question": "What is unique about the pelvic splanchnic nerves compared to other splanchnic nerves in the body?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic root) are unique. They are the only splanchnic nerves that carry parasympathetic fibers. In other words, they do not originate from the sympathetic trunks. Rather, they originate directly from the anterior rami of S2 to S4. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originating in the sacral spinal cord pass from the S2 to S4 spinal nerves to the inferior hypogastric plexus (Fig. 4.136). Once in this plexus, some of these fibers pass upward, enter the abdominal prevertebral plexus, and distribute with the arteries supplying the hindgut. This provides the pathway for innervation of the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon by preganglionic parasympathetic fibers.", "answer": "The pelvic splanchnic nerves are unique because they are the only splanchnic nerves that carry parasympathetic fibers."}

Doppler ultrasound enables determination of flow, its direction, and its velocity within a vessel using simple ultrasound techniques. Sound waves bounce off moving structures and are returned. The degree of frequency shift determines whether the object is moving away from or toward the probe and the speed at which it is traveling. Precise measurements of blood flow and blood velocity can therefore be obtained, which in turn can indicate sites of blockage in blood vessels. Computed tomography (CT) was invented in the 1970s by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1979.

The castor plant, Ricinus communis , is known to have a toxic chemical called ricin. If an individual eats Ricinus seeds directly, the ricin toxin can take effect in as little as 4 to 12 hours. Signs and symptoms of ricin toxicity include gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, pulmonary edema, and inflammation. These symptoms occur due to the inactivating effect of ricin toxin on ribosomes making the body unable to create proteins. The clinician needs to provide supportive care to the patient during ricin toxicity as currently, there is no antidote. The extraction process of castor oil due to ricin's water-soluble properties negates these toxic properties. [10] Castor oil gets purified of ricin during the extraction process. Castor oil is completely safe for human consumption with minimal toxic effects in both acute and chronic settings. Castor oil has also demonstrated no genotoxic effects.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_3011_2", "question": "How does information primarily reach the hippocampal formation?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The hippocampal formation is located in the medial ventral temporal lobe (eFig. 9.102). It consists of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum (eFig. 9.103A and B). The hippocampal formation plays a role in memory processes such as episodic memory, short-term memory, working memory, and consolidation of memories. Input to the hippocampal formation is primarily received by the entorhinal cortex from association cortices. Because of this, it is believed that the “storage” of memories is in the association and primary cortices, not in the medial temporal lobe. Neurons from the entorhinal cortex project to the hippocampal formation by two pathways: the perforant pathway and alvear pathway. The perforant courses directly through the hippocampal sulcus to reach the dentate gyrus (eFig. 9.104B).

Extension of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers is performed by the extensor digitorum muscle. Placing the fist in a palm-down position on the table and pressing the middle phalanges onto the table effectively immobilizes the action of the extensor digitorum. The freshman was therefore unable to elevate his middle finger (which was sticking out). It is important to remember that if this same procedure is carried out leaving the index or little finger free to move, they do. This is because these two digits are extended not only by the extensor digitorum muscle but also by the extensor indicis muscle (index finger) and extensor digiti minimi muscle (little finger).

It sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well. [1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1840_2", "question": "What is the ulnar artery's role in blood supply to the hand?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. In the distal forearm, the ulnar artery often remains tucked under the anterolateral lip of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, and is therefore not easily palpable. In distal regions of the forearm, the ulnar nerve is immediately medial to the ulnar artery. The ulnar artery leaves the forearm, enters the hand by passing lateral to the pisiform bone and superficial to the flexor retinaculum of the wrist, and arches over the palm (Fig. 7.88).

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_401_2", "question": "What can happen if a papillary muscle necrosis occurs following a heart attack?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Simply put, the papillary muscles and associated chordae tendineae keep the valves closed during the dramatic changes in ventricular size that occur during contraction. In addition, chordae tendineae from two papillary muscles attach to each cusp. This helps prevent separation of the cusps during ventricular contraction. Proper closing of the tricuspid valve causes blood to exit the right ventricle and move into the pulmonary trunk. Necrosis of a papillary muscle following a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may result in prolapse of the related valve.", "answer": "Prolapse of the related valve."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2250_2", "question": "What is the pathway through which postganglionic sympathetic fibers reach the eyeball to innervate the dilator pupillae muscle?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Preganglionic sympathetic fibers arise from the upper segments of the thoracic spinal cord, mainly T1. They enter the sympathetic chain through white rami communicantes, and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic sympathetic fibers. The postganglionic fibers are distributed along the internal carotid artery and its branches. The postganglionic sympathetic fibers destined for the orbit travel with the ophthalmic artery. Once in the orbit the fibers are distributed to the eyeball either by: passing through the ciliary ganglion, without synapsing, and joining the short ciliary nerves, which pass from the ganglion to the eyeball; or passing through long ciliary nerves to reach the eyeball. In the eyeball postganglionic sympathetic fibers innervate the dilator pupillae muscle.", "answer": "The pathway through which postganglionic sympathetic fibers reach the eyeball to innervate the dilator pupillae muscle is either by passing through the ciliary ganglion without synapsing and joining the short ciliary nerves, or by passing through the long ciliary nerves."}

As the lesion expands, the brain becomes compressed and the intracranial pressure increases. This pressure compresses vessels, so lowering the cerebral perfusion pressure. To combat this the homeostatic mechanisms of the body increase the blood pressure to overcome the increase in intracerebral pressure. Unfortunately, the increase in intracranial pressure is compounded by the cerebral edema that occurs at and after the initial insult. An urgent surgical procedure was performed.", "answer": "Intracranial pressure increases."}

Through this section we have described a collection of anatomical structures and defined their connections with other areas of the brain and brainstem without exploring how these individual structures are interconnected with one another. In the 1930s James Papez, an American neurologist, described a circuit that links these structures and cortical areas together in a way that was thought to be involved in the experience and expression of emotion. This is referred to as the Papez circuit (eFig. 9.106). The circuit begins with fibers from the subiculum, which then enter the fornix to reach the mammillary nuclei. These axons then project through the mammillothalamic tract to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus.

Pulmonary function tests are performed to assess lung function. Spirometry is the most common and widely used lung function test, followed by diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). It is also known as the transfer factor. [1] DLCO is a measurement to assess the lungs' ability to transfer gas from inspired air to the bloodstream. [2] Carbon monoxide (CO) has a high affinity for hemoglobin, and it follows the same pathway as that of oxygen to finally bind with hemoglobin. Inhaled CO is used for this test due to its high affinity for hemoglobin (200 to 250 times that of oxygen). Among other potential gases for evaluating diffusing capacity, oxygen is not preferred since its uptake is limited by cardiac uptake and total body consumption. In brief, during a ten-second breath-hold, DLCO measures uptake of CO per unit time per mm of driving pressure of CO (cc of CO/sec/mm of Hg).", "answer": "DLCO is measured by assessing the uptake of inhaled CO during a ten-second breath-hold, quantified as cc of CO/sec/mm of Hg."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_20_0", "question": "In what year was nuclear magnetic resonance imaging first described?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was first described in 1946 and used to determine the structure of complex molecules. The process of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is dependent on the free protons in the hydrogen nuclei in molecules of water (H2O). Because water is present in almost all biological tissues, the hydrogen proton is ideal. The protons within a patient’s hydrogen nuclei can be regarded as small bar magnets, which are randomly oriented in space. The patient is placed in a strong magnetic field, which aligns the bar magnets. When a pulse of radio waves is passed through the patient the magnets are deflected, and as they return to their aligned position they emit small radio pulses.

Any decrease in perceived fetal movement should be followed up by the healthcare provider with a non-stress test. This non-invasive test can evaluate fetal movement and fetal heart rate accelerations. A reactive non-stress test must have accelerations of the fetal heart of a specific size, duration, and frequency. This includes at least three fetal heart tone (FHT) accelerations, which are at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline and last at least 15 seconds, all within a 20-minute window. A non-reactive non-stress test, one that does not have the three accelerations, could indicate fetal sleep or fetal compromise, and further testing should be done. Usually, the non-stress test is first extended for a longer time to determine if the lack of accelerations was just due to fetal sleep. If the non-stress test continues to be non-reactive, then a BPP (biophysical profile) is often completed. This is an ultrasound of the fetus to assess fetal breathing movement, fetal movement of the body or limbs, fetal tone, and amniotic fluid volume. If this test does not reassure the healthcare provider, then the delivery of the fetus should be considered. [7] One study found that increased fetal movements may be used to predict adverse neonatal outcomes such as large for gestational age.

This test demonstrates the conditions of ulnar-only artery flow to the hand. If there is a clinical suggestion of ischemia, the flap is aborted. Of course, this test can be done at any time during the procedure, based on the surgeon’s preference. If the surgeon is otherwise confident about the hand’s ability to perfuse the ulnar artery alone, the procedure can be continued by ligating the distal venae comitantes and the radial artery. A silk suture is used to ligate the radial artery with a long tail placed on the flap side to facilitate observation of pulsations in the distal flap after the tourniquet is released and after microvascular anastomosis is completed.

The hearing is the process by which sound vibrations transform from the external environment into action potentials. Vibrating objects produce sounds, like the strings of a guitar, and this vibrations pressure pulses into air molecules, better known as sound waves. So, the ear is equipped to distinguish different characteristics of sound, such as pitch and loudness; which refers to the frequency of sound waves and the perception of the intensity of sound, respectively. Frequency measurement is in hertz (Hz, cycles per second). The human ear can detect frequencies from 1000 to 4000 hertz, but a young ear can hear frequencies in the range between 20 and 20000 hertz. The intensity of sound is measured in decibels (dB); the range of human hearing on a decibel scale is from 0 to 130 dB (where the sound becomes painful). All these physical properties have to incur transformations to get into the central nervous system. The first transformation consists of the conversion of air vibrations into tympanic membrane vibrations. These vibrations then get transmitted into the middle ear and the ossicles. Then these vibrations transform into liquid vibrations in the inner ear and the cochlea, and these stimulate a region called the basilar membrane and the organ of Corti. Finally, these vibrations get transformed into nerve impulses, which travel to the nervous system. [1]", "answer": "Hertz (Hz)"}

Abnormal lumps can be detected by palpation, and diagnosis can be made using ultrasound. Simple ultrasound scanning can reveal the extent of the local tumor, usually at an early stage. Surgical removal of the malignant testis is often carried out using an inguinal approach. The testis is not usually removed through a scrotal incision, because it is possible to spread tumor cells into the subcutaneous tissues of the scrotum, which has a different lymphatic drainage than the testis.

A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele. The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs.

If acute cholecystitis is suspected and there is a negative gallbladder ultrasound, then a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid or HIDA scan is indicated. This is done by injecting technetium Tc 99m intravenously. It is taken up by the liver and excreted into the biliary system. If there is no filling of the gallbladder, then this would indicate complete mechanical or functional blockage of the cystic duct. This finding is close to 100% accurate for diagnosing acute cholecystitis. If a patient has characteristic symptoms of nonacute cholecystitis or biliary cholic and the gallbladder ultrasound is negative, they could have chronic acalculous cholecystitis. This is a functional problem caused by the hypokinetic emptying of the gallbladder. The best diagnostic test for this condition is a HIDA scan with KINAVAC (cholecystokinin-CCK). Tc 99m is administered as with a routine HIDA scan. Once the gallbladder is visualized, then the KINAVAC is administered intravenously. This simulates eating and causes the gallbladder to contract and empty. The percent that the gallbladder empties, called ejection fraction (EF), is measured digitally. An ejection fraction of below 30-35% is considered abnormal and possibly indicative of acalculous cholecystitis. Documented reproduction of symptoms with administration of the KINAVAC may also be indicative of gallbladder disease. Some studies have shown a 95% accuracy rate in detecting acalculous cholecystitis with a low EF in a HIDA scan. Other studies found that the accuracy of a HIDA scan may be altered in the presence of other ailments, especially other gastrointestinal (GI) conditions.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28861635", "answer": "Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is diagnosed using a HIDA scan with KINAVAC by assessing the gallbladder's ejection fraction, with values below 30-35% considered indicative of the condition, along with the reproduction of symptoms upon KINAVAC administration."}

Blockage of the hepatic portal vein or of vascular channels in the liver Blockage of the hepatic portal vein or of vascular channels in the liver can affect the pattern of venous return from abdominal parts of the gastrointestinal system. Vessels that interconnect the portal and caval systems can become greatly enlarged and tortuous, allowing blood in tributaries of the portal system to bypass the liver, enter the caval system, and thereby return to the heart. Portal hypertension can result in esophageal and rectal varices and in caput medusae in which systemic vessels that radiate from para-umbilical veins enlarge and become visible on the abdominal wall. Abdominal viscera are supplied by a large prevertebral plexus Innervation of the abdominal viscera is derived from a large prevertebral plexus associated mainly with the anterior and lateral surfaces of the aorta (Fig. 4.20).

{"id": "article-18998_12_1", "question": "What are some signs and symptoms of ricin toxicity?", "doc_chunk": "Castor Oil -- Toxicity. The castor plant, Ricinus communis , is known to have a toxic chemical called ricin. If an individual eats Ricinus seeds directly, the ricin toxin can take effect in as little as 4 to 12 hours. Signs and symptoms of ricin toxicity include gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, pulmonary edema, and inflammation. These symptoms occur due to the inactivating effect of ricin toxin on ribosomes making the body unable to create proteins. The clinician needs to provide supportive care to the patient during ricin toxicity as currently, there is no antidote. The extraction process of castor oil due to ricin's water-soluble properties negates these toxic properties. [10] Castor oil gets purified of ricin during the extraction process. Castor oil is completely safe for human consumption with minimal toxic effects in both acute and chronic settings. Castor oil has also demonstrated no genotoxic effects. Due to its well-known safety, castor oil is also used widely for nonmedical purposes, such as lubrication, cosmetics, and coatings.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2881_0", "question": "How does the neural tube form during embryonic development?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. During the third week of development the outermost layer of the embryo—the ectoderm—thickens to form a neural plate (eFig. 9.2A). This plate develops a longitudinally running neural groove, which deepens so that it is flanked on either side by neural folds (eFig. 9.2B). These folds further develop and eventually fuse during a process called neurulation to form a long tubelike structure called the neural tube with an inner lumen called the neural canal (eFig. 9.3). Fusion of the tube starts at the midpoint and extends cranially and caudally so that the tube is fully formed by the fourth week. Continued proliferation of the cells at the cephalic end cause the neural tube to dilate and form the three primary brain vesicles (eFig. 9.4): the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain), which later give rise to the structures of the brain.

A part of the dorsal vagal complex, the area postrema is well studied as the vomiting center. It also is one of the circumventricular organs, which can detect circulating chemical messengers in the blood and incorporate neural inputs in the brainstem. [1] They accomplish this by sensing blood-borne baroreceptor information from the carotid sinus and aorta, along with information from the liver via osmoreceptors. The absence of tight junctions between endothelial cells and its composition of sinusoidal fenestrated capillaries aids in physiologic signaling with its neurons, playing a role in the cardiovascular system and those that regulate feeding and metabolism. It mediates the effect of angiotensin II, which increases the arterial blood pressure without significantly impacting the heart rate. Additionally, neurons in the area postrema can use stretch receptors in the stomach to integrate mechanical information; this aids in somatic growth and in stimulating appetite. [1] These functions are immature are birth and develop over time. A less studied role includes the impact on the respiratory drive: when stimulated, the neurons increase respiratory drive, and when damaged, they contribute to the decrease in respiratory rate.

Treatment of patients with abdominal gunshot injury begins with the initial contact of personnel who arrive at the scene of injury, such as paramedics. In penetrating abdominal injury due to a gunshot wound, initial treatment can be paramount for the prognosis and survival of the victim. The most important task for the initial assessment is to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation of the patient and stop the bleeding. Once a clear airway is established, the cervical spine must be protected if indicated by the mechanism of injury. Assessment of breath sounds is essential as the location of the wound on the abdomen does not rule out injuries to structures outside of the abdomen. Efforts to obtain hemostasis before arriving at the emergency room may entail pressure on the wound. Depending on materials available, gauze, shirts, towels, and any other fabrics can be applied with pressure to aid in coagulation. A tourniquet may be utilized if a professional can apply to the area affected, but this is less likely with abdominal gunshot wounds than extremity wounds. If, when assessing vital signs, the patient is no longer breathing or loses pulses, the protocol of CPR should be initiated immediately. For patients with hemodynamic instability, aggressive fluid resuscitation should be initiated, and blood should be typed and screened.

Treatment of patients with abdominal gunshot injury begins with the initial contact of personnel who arrive at the scene of injury, such as paramedics. In penetrating abdominal injury due to a gunshot wound, initial treatment can be paramount for the prognosis and survival of the victim. The most important task for the initial assessment is to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation of the patient and stop the bleeding. Once a clear airway is established, the cervical spine must be protected if indicated by the mechanism of injury. Assessment of breath sounds is essential as the location of the wound on the abdomen does not rule out injuries to structures outside of the abdomen. Efforts to obtain hemostasis before arriving at the emergency room may entail pressure on the wound. Depending on materials available, gauze, shirts, towels, and any other fabrics can be applied with pressure to aid in coagulation. A tourniquet may be utilized if a professional can apply to the area affected, but this is less likely with abdominal gunshot wounds than extremity wounds. If, when assessing vital signs, the patient is no longer breathing or loses pulses, the protocol of CPR should be initiated immediately. For patients with hemodynamic instability, aggressive fluid resuscitation should be initiated, and blood should be typed and screened. O negative blood should be made ready for an emergency transfusion, with it being the lower risk of causing serious adverse transfusion reactions.

Whenever a patient undergoes an X-ray or nuclear medicine investigation, a dose of radiation is given (Table 1.1). As a general principle it is expected that the dose given is as low as reasonably possible for a diagnostic image to be obtained. Numerous laws govern the amount of radiation exposure that a patient can undergo for a variety of procedures, and these are monitored to prevent any excess or additional dosage. Whenever a radiograph is booked, the clinician ordering the procedure must appreciate its necessity and understand the dose given to the patient to ensure that the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.", "answer": "Nuclear medicine images are usually interpreted directly from a computer."}

Expert Opin Pharmacother 15(9):1247-1264, 2014). Among these transdermal gels and intramuscular injections are the most widely used in the US. Testosterone gels are generally recommended due to patient preference, cost, convenience, and insurance coverage. The primary advantage of gels is the maintenance of stable serum testosterone concentrations resulting in stable libido, energy, and mood. There are various commercial prescription testosterone gel products, in varying concentrations. Gels should be applied to shoulder, upper arms, or abdomen and shouldn't be applied to the scrotum. Miller and colleagues (9) showed that the bioavailability of testosterone gel is 30 percent lower when applied to the abdomen compared to the arms or shoulders [12] . It is generally recommended that intramuscular injections of testosterone with testosterone enanthate or testosterone cypionate be given 50 to 100mg doses every week or 100 to 200mg doses every two weeks. In 2014, the FDA approved an extra-long acting intramuscular injectable form of testosterone called testosterone undecanoate which is administered at an initial dose of 750mg followed by a second dose four weeks later with subsequent doses given at ten week intervals.

{"id": "article-536_2_1", "question": "What is the primary protein involved in the formation of fructosamine?", "doc_chunk": "Fructosamine -- Pathophysiology. Fructosamine (1-amino-1-deoxy fructose), is a stable ketoamine, formed by the reaction between glucose and the amino group of protein (predominantly albumin, but also including globulins and lipoprotein). The attachment of the aldehyde group of the carbohydrate with the N terminal amino acid of the protein forms the reversible Schiff base product, the aldimine intermediate. The Schiff base product may be converted back to glucose and protein, or undergo the Amadori rearrangement to form stable fructosamine. This process is known as non-enzymatic glycation and is also referred to as the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction causes the browning phenomenon that occurs in milk and other food products when heated. Glycated albumin refers to the formation of ketoamine specifically involving the major circulating protein albumin (3.5 g/dl to 5 g/dl). Glycated albumin is an example of a fructosamine (FA). Because albumin is the most abundant of the serum proteins, fructosamine is predominantly a measure of glycated albumin.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1070_0", "question": "How is the cervix shaped and positioned within the female reproductive system?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The fimbriated infundibulum facilitates the collection of ovulated eggs from the ovary. Fertilization normally occurs in the ampulla. The cervix forms the inferior part of the uterus and is shaped like a short, broad cylinder with a narrow central channel. The body of the uterus normally arches forward (anteflexed on the cervix) over the superior surface of the emptied bladder (Fig. 5.55A). In addition, the cervix is angled forward (anteverted) on the vagina so that the inferior end of the cervix projects into the upper anterior aspect of the vagina. Because the end of the cervix is dome shaped, it bulges into the vagina, and a gutter, or fornix, is formed around the margin of the cervix where it joins the vaginal wall (Fig. 5.55B). The tubular central canal of the cervix opens, below, as the external os, into the vaginal cavity and, above, as the internal os, into the uterine cavity.", "answer": "The cervix is shaped like a short, broad cylinder with a narrow central channel."}

In the clinic Injuries to the brachial plexus The brachial plexus is an extremely complex structure. When damaged, it requires meticulous clinical history taking and examination. Assessment of the individual nerve functions can be obtained by nerve conduction studies and electromyography, which assess the latency of muscle contraction when the nerve is artificially stimulated. Brachial plexus injuries are usually the result of blunt trauma producing nerve avulsions and disruption. These injuries are usually devastating for the function of the upper limb and require many months of dedicated rehabilitation for even a small amount of function to return. Spinal cord injuries in the cervical region and direct pulling injuries tend to affect the roots of the brachial plexus. Severe trauma to the first rib usually affects the trunks. The divisions and cords of the brachial plexus can be injured by dislocation of the glenohumeral joint.

The full extent of neurological injury can be evaluated on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which has better soft tissue resolution compared to CT. MRI is also useful for identifying strokes that may be too small to detect on a CT scan. MRI scans are produced by using complicated algorithms that create a series of images, also known as sequences. Various sequences can be obtained to assess different anatomical and physiological properties of the brain. A stroke, whether acute or chronic, will appear as a bright region on a sequence that is sensitive to fluid (T2 weighted) (Fig. 8.40B). To identify whether a stroke is acute, further sequences are obtained, known as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig. 8.40C) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (Fig. 8.40D) map.

How the osteotomies are performed depends upon the surgeon's preference. It is the author's preference to perform right-angle cuts to remove a rectangular block of bone through the distal and proximal limits of the osteotomies, as opposed to a “canoe boat” or “keel-boat” which is often described. When exposing the bone for osteotomy, care is taken to preserve the periosteum over the bone. The length of the bone to be harvested is delineated. The limits of the bone harvest are the head of the radius distally and the insertion of the pronator teres muscle proximally. Roughly 50% of the height of the radius is identified by visual inspection and palpation with the arm pronated and supinated. A scalpel can be used to incise the periosteum and mark the planned osteotomies. Osteotomies can then be made with the saw along the incised periosteum. Care should be taken during the completion of the vertical osteotomies to avoid pass-cutting into the residual radius.  Doing so can weaken the bone that remains after graft harvest.

All patients with suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) should be evaluated with an echocardiogram, to check the LV wall thickness, systolic and diastolic function, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and presence of mitral regurgitation. Clinical diagnosis of HCM is possible with the finding of LV hypertrophy on echocardiogram. [17] In HCM, the Systolic anterior motion SAM of the mitral valve can result in obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract. A left ventricular outflow tract gradient over 30mmHg is as common as 20 to 25% of patients. The left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is a predictor of the development of severe symptoms of heart failure and a predictor of death. [18] Other findings associated with LVOT obstruction can be asymmetric septal hypertrophy, partial early systolic closure of the aortic valve, calcification of the mitral annulus and mitral regurgitation. Symptomatic patients with HCM without evidence of LVOT obstruction at rest should undergo a stress echocardiogram to evaluate the possibility of an obstruction on exertion; this will help to start early treatment. [19] The presence of increased left atrial size is a predictor of a poor outcome in HCM and is associated with the development of atrial fibrillation. [20] Increased left atrial volume index (LAVI) and GLS are both associated with worse outcomes in HCM, and they can both be used to optimize the risk stratification in HCM patients.

Nintey-five percent of the total testosterone in males is synthesized in the Leydig cells of the testis. Defects, whether acquired or congenital, that interefere with interactions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis can cause male hypogonadism It is essential to distinguish between primary hypogonadism (which originates in the testes) and secondary hypogonadism (which originates in the hypothalamus or pituitary). Symptoms highly suggestive of hypogonadism include decreased spontaneous erections, decreased nocturnal penile tumescence, decreased libido, and reduced testicular volume. The normal range for early morning testosterone in a male is between 300 ng/dL to 1000 ng/dL [1] . Hypogonadism is diagnosed when the morning serum testosterone level is less than 300 ng/dL. However, clinical judgment can be exercised in the diagnosis of hypogonadism for patients with persistent symptoms of testosterone deficiency despite having testosterone levels are in the normal range [2] . Of note, total testosterone less than 405.9 ng/dL is below the fifth percentile [3] .

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1648_2", "question": "What structure is responsible for compressing the common plantar nerve in a Morton’s neuroma?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. In the clinic A Morton’s neuroma is an enlarged common plantar nerve, usually in the third interspace between the third and fourth toes. In this region of the foot the lateral plantar nerve often unites with the medial plantar nerve. As the two nerves join, the resulting nerve is typically larger in diameter than those of the other toes. Also, it is in a relatively subcutaneous position, just above the fat pad of the foot close to the artery and the vein. Above the nerve is the deep transverse metatarsal ligament, which is a broad strong structure holding the metatarsals together. Typically, as the patient enters the “push-off” phase of walking the interdigital nerve is sandwiched between the ground and the deep transverse metatarsal ligament. The forces tend to compress the common plantar nerve, which can be irritated, in which case there is usually some associated inflammatory change and thickening.", "answer": "deep transverse metatarsal ligament."}

Blood flow was from the superior mesenteric artery into the aneurysm sac. Above the level of the graft the superior mesenteric artery arises normally. From the right colic and middle colic branches a marginal branch around the colon anastomoses, in the region of the splenic flexure, with marginal branches from the inferior mesenteric artery (this can become a hypertrophied vessel known as the marginal artery of Drummond). In this situation, blood passed retrogradely into the inferior mesenteric artery, filling the aneurysm and allowing it to remain pressurized and expand. The inferior mesenteric artery was ligated laparoscopically and the aneurysm failed to expand further. Over the ensuing 6 months the aneurysm contracted.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_306_0", "question": "What structures make up the breasts?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Nerves, vessels, and lymphatics in the superficial compartment emerge from the thoracic wall, the axilla, and the neck. The breasts consist of mammary glands and associated skin and connective tissues. The mammary glands are modified sweat glands in the superficial fascia anterior to the pectoral muscles and the anterior thoracic wall (Fig. 3.16). The mammary glands consist of a series of ducts and associated secretory lobules. These converge to form 15 to 20 lactiferous ducts, which open independently onto the nipple. The nipple is surrounded by a circular pigmented area of skin termed the areola. A well-developed, connective tissue stroma surrounds the ducts and lobules of the mammary gland. In certain regions, this condenses to form well-defined ligaments, the suspensory ligaments of breast, which are continuous with the dermis of the skin and support the breast. Carcinoma of the breast creates tension on these ligaments, causing pitting of the skin.", "answer": "The structures that make up the breasts include the mammary glands, ducts, secretory lobules, lactiferous ducts, nipple, areola, connective tissue stroma, and suspensory ligaments of the breast."}

Each of these triangles contains numerous structures that can be identified as being within a specific triangle, passing into a specific triangle from outside the area, originating in one triangle and passing to another triangle, or passing through several triangles while passing through the region. A discussion of the anterior triangle of the neck must therefore combine a systemic approach, describing the muscles, vessels, and nerves in the area, with a regional approach, describing the contents of each triangle. The muscles in the anterior triangle of the neck (Table 8.12) can be grouped according to their location relative to the hyoid bone: Muscles superior to the hyoid are classified as suprahyoid muscles and include the stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, and geniohyoid.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_573_0", "question": "What can cause rib notching in the context of aorta coarctation?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. A 20-year-old man visited his family doctor because he had a cough. A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs.", "answer": "Rib notching in the context of aorta coarctation is caused by the enlargement of collateral intercostal arteries due to increased pressure above the narrowing of the aorta, which leads to the formation of dilated vessels that notch the ribs."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_15_0", "question": "How is subtraction angiography used to improve visualization during angiography?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. During angiography it is often difficult to appreciate the contrast agent in the vessels through the overlying bony structures. To circumvent this, the technique of subtraction angiography has been developed. Simply, one or two images are obtained before the injection of contrast media. These images are inverted (such that a negative is created from the positive image). After injection of the contrast media into the vessels, a further series of images are obtained, demonstrating the passage of the contrast through the arteries into the veins and around the circulation. By adding the “negative precontrast image” to the positive postcontrast images, the bones and soft tissues are subtracted to produce a solitary image of contrast only. Before the advent of digital imaging this was a challenge, but now the use of computers has made this technique relatively straightforward and instantaneous (Fig. 1.5). Ultrasonography of the body is widely used for all aspects of medicine.", "answer": "Subtraction angiography improves visualization during angiography by using precontrast images as negatives, which when added to postcontrast images, allow for the subtraction of bones and soft tissues, thus enhancing the visibility of the contrast media in the vessels."}

Fatty acids and proteins stimulate the release of CCK via a direct action on the I-cells. GPR40 is a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on I-cells that responds to long-chain fatty acids. Discharge of vagal efferent neurons is stimulated by the action of CCK on CCK-1 receptors and increase intracellular calcium. They find these neurons in both the stomach and small intestines, and CCK initially activates the afferent fibers in the small intestine via a paracrine mechanism. This inhibits the excitatory vagal efferent pathway to the distal stomach. Gastric vagal afferents are stimulated in response to the hormonal effect coupled with the inhibitory vagal efferent pathway to the proximal stomach. [9] Due to the mechanism mentioned above, CCK can inhibit gastric emptying by relaxing the proximal portion of the stomach, which increases tension in the pyloric sphincter. At high levels of CCK can increase the effect of how fast gastric emptying occurs, and it does this by increasing the excitatory effect it has on both the small and large intestine, which leads to movement in the bowels or by improving the tension of the pyloric sphincter. [5] Therefore, the reflex control of gastric emptying is regulated by CCK action on vasovagal reflexes and the hormonal activation of a variety of pathways that are coupled to vagal efferent pathways controlling gastric motility.", "answer": "GPR40"}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_525_2", "question": "What structures can lung cancer cells invade, making the tumor inoperable?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. In the clinic It is important to stage lung cancer because the treatment depends on its stage. If a small malignant nodule is found within the lung, it can sometimes be excised and the prognosis is excellent. Unfortunately, many patients present with a tumor mass that has invaded structures in the mediastinum or the pleurae or has metastasized. The tumor may then be inoperable and is treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Spread of the tumor is by lymphatics to lymph nodes within the hila, mediastinum, and root of the neck. A key factor affecting the prognosis and ability to cure the disease is the distant spread of metastases. Imaging methods to assess spread include plain radiography (Fig. 3.54A), computed tomography (CT; Fig. 3.54B,C), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Increasingly, radionuclide studies using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET; Fig. 3.54D) are being used.", "answer": "mediastinum, pleurae"}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2268_1", "question": "What role do zonular fibers play in the eye's anatomy?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The ciliary muscle consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged longitudinally, circularly, and radially. Controlled by parasympathetics traveling to the orbit in the oculomotor nerve [III], these muscle fibers, on contraction, decrease the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. The ciliary processes are longitudinal ridges projecting from the inner surface of the ciliary body (Fig. 8.110). Extending from them are zonular fibers attached to the lens of the eyeball, which suspend the lens in its proper position and collectively form the suspensory ligament of the lens. Contraction of the ciliary muscle decreases the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. This reduces tension on the suspensory ligament of the lens.

The nerves of the upper limb originate from the brachial plexus, which surrounds the axillary artery within the axilla. Importantly, the axillary artery, axillary vein, and brachial plexus lie within the sleeve-like covering of fascia termed the axillary sheath. By injecting the anesthetic into the space enclosed by the axillary sheath, all of the nerves of the brachial plexus were paralyzed. It is possible with a patient’s arm abducted and externally rotated (palm behind the head) to easily palpate the axillary artery and therefore locate the position of the axillary sheath. Once the axillary artery has been identified, a small needle can be placed beside the vessel and local anesthetic can be injected on both sides of it. The local anesthetic tracks along the axillary sheath in this region. The brachial plexus surrounding the axillary artery is therefore completely anesthetized and an effective local anesthetic “block” is achieved.", "answer": "By injecting anesthetic into the axillary sheath."}

The size and quality of the bone harvested are also significant limiting factors in the use of this flap. Reconstructions that require more than 10 to 12 cm of bone, such as a total mandibulectomy, cannot be reconstructed with a single OCRFFF. The thickness of the bone is also limited. Under optimal conditions, the fibular free flap is preferred for bony reconstructions. It offers many of the same qualities the OCRFFF does; it is pliable, thin, and has a long pedicle. It has the added advantage, however, of greater bone stock thickness, and most lower extremity weight-bearing is on the tibia, not the fibula. The fibular free flap similarly requires that blood flow to the distal extremity (i.e., the foot) be sufficient after the loss of the contribution of the peroneal artery. This might not be a major issue in a young trauma patient needing osseous free flap reconstruction. However, head and neck cancer patients, who may have smoking-related vasculopathy, be of older age, and may have other medical comorbidities, may have insufficient blood flow to the distal extremity (or through the peroneal artery) to support the fibular flap as a viable reconstruction option. It is not uncommon for a vascular study to contraindicate the use of the fibular flap, leaving the osteocutaneous radial forearm, scapular/parascapular flaps, or iliac crest flap as the next option. Each of these reconstructive options has advantages and disadvantages associated with it.", "answer": "Vascular issues can contraindicate the use of the fibular flap, necessitating the consideration of alternative reconstructive options."}

The two vertical muscles in the anterolateral group of abdominal wall muscles are the large rectus abdominis and the small pyramidalis (Fig. 4.32, Table 4.1). The rectus abdominis is a long, flat muscle and extends the length of the anterior abdominal wall. It is a paired muscle, separated in the midline by the linea alba, and it widens and thins as it ascends from the pubic symphysis to the costal margin. Along its course, it is intersected by three or four transverse fibrous bands or tendinous intersections (Fig. 4.32). These are easily visible on individuals with well-developed rectus abdominis muscles. The second vertical muscle is the pyramidalis. This small, triangular muscle, which may be absent, is anterior to the rectus abdominis and has its base on the pubis, and its apex is attached superiorly and medially to the linea alba (Fig. 4.32).", "answer": "Rectus abdominis and pyramidalis."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_648_1", "question": "Who is more commonly affected by inguinal hernias - males or females?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The groin (inguinal region) is the area of junction between the anterior abdominal wall and the thigh. In this area, the abdominal wall is weakened from changes that occur during development and a peritoneal sac or diverticulum, with or without abdominal contents, can therefore protrude through it, creating an inguinal hernia. This type of hernia can occur in both sexes, but it is most common in males. The inherent weakness in the anterior abdominal wall in the groin is caused by changes that occur during the development of the gonads. Before the descent of the testes and ovaries from their initial position high in the posterior abdominal wall, a peritoneal outpouching (the processus vaginalis) forms (Fig. 4.41), protruding through the various layers of the anterior abdominal wall and acquiring coverings from each: The transversalis fascia forms its deepest covering.", "answer": "Males"}
{"id": "article-21222_24_0", "question": "What are some drainage procedures used in treating epidural abscesses?", "doc_chunk": "Epidural Abscess -- Treatment / Management. IEA treatment usually requires a combination of a drainage procedure and antibiotic therapy, like most abscesses. Someone can use craniotomy or simple burr holes for drainage. If it involves the dura, graft or other occlusive approaches might be helpful. After clinicians get samples and cultures, they should start antibiotics as soon as possible. Since this is a relatively rare disease, information available for antibiotic choice is mostly anecdotal. They should choose antibiotics for Streptococcus , Hemophilus , and anaerobes to cover infections that have spread from the ear, sinuses, or other areas of the head and neck. Third-generation cephalosporins plus vancomycin plus metronidazole is one regimen. They can then change treatment based on cultures and sensitivities. [15] Vancomycin does not cross the blood-brain barrier; therefore, some authors advocate using Rifampin in its place while others may consider a short course of steroids. Linezolid and daptomycin have also been used, but data on their efficacy is very limited. Antibiotic therapy is usually 6 to 8 weeks of intravenous agents since oral agents will probably not achieve a therapeutic level in CSF that is needed for a cure. Clinicians might manage sinus-related IEA in children without cranial drainage procedures if they can do an effective sinus drainage procedure and the abscess is not showing signs of increased ICP.

Given the patient’s specific clinical findings, bronchial pneumonia was unlikely. From the clinical findings it was clear that the patient was likely to have a pneumonia confined to a lobe. Because there are only two lobes in the left lung, the likely diagnosis was a left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest radiograph was obtained (eFig. 3.121). The posteroanterior view of the chest demonstrated an area of veil-like opacification throughout the whole of the left lung. Knowing the position of the oblique fissure, any consolidation within the left upper lobe will produce this veil-like shadowing. Lateral radiographs are usually not necessary but would demonstrate opacification anteriorly and superiorly that ends abruptly at the oblique fissure.

{"id": "article-34_6_2", "question": "What is Goodsall's rule and how is it used in determining the origin of a fistula tract?", "doc_chunk": "Anal Fistulotomy -- Anatomy and Physiology. Based on the origin of the anorectal fistula development from cryptoglandular abscesses, the internal opening of most fistulas is located at the dentate line. The type of fistula is most commonly diagnosed at an anorectal examination under anesthesia, where anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy can be performed at the time of fistula tract exploration. The decision of which structures the fistula connection incorporates, i.e., internal and external sphincter complex is important as only a small amount of external sphincter muscle that can be cut. [7] Up to 30% of the external sphincter muscle can be cut without compromising fecal continence. To avoid the cutting of too much external sphincter and to decrease the risk of fecal incontinence as well as to allow adequate drainage following abscess drainage, a Seton can be placed through the tract. Seton can either be utilized to slowly cut through the sphincter muscle over time, called 'cutting Seton.' Setons can also be placed into fistula tracks to allow previously undrained collections to heal around the seton slowly, called a 'non-cutting Seton.' In addition to the depth of the fistula, there are certain clues as to where the fistula tract originates from the location of the external opening. This is from Goodsall's rule, which states that if a transverse line is drawn across the anus, a fistulous external opening which is anterior to this line and will be located internally 3 cm of the anal verge, with the fistulas tract radially and directly into the anal canal. However, if the external opening is posterior to this line or outside of the 3 to 4 cm area from the anal verge, then these fistulas tend to arc around to the posterior midline anal gland. These arching fistula tracts are sometimes difficult to completely discern at the first operation, so the tract can be partially unroofed towards to anal verge being careful to avoid the destruction of the external anal sphincter. Although Goodsall's rule has been taught for years, there are some challenges to this rule recently; however, for simple fistulas, it is a good starting point. [8]", "answer": "Goodsall's rule is used to predict the internal origin of an anal fistula based on the location of its external opening relative to a transverse line across the anus, aiding in surgical planning and management."}

There are many ways of classifying pelvic fractures, which enable the surgeon to determine the appropriate treatment and the patient’s prognosis. Pelvic fractures are generally of four types. Type 1 injuries occur without disruption of the bony pelvic ring (e.g., a fracture of the iliac crest). These types of injuries are unlikely to represent significant trauma, though in the case of a fracture of the iliac crest, blood loss needs to be assessed. Type 2 injuries occur with a single break in the bony pelvic ring. An example of this would be a single fracture with diastasis (separation) of the symphysis pubis. Again, these injuries are relatively benign in nature, but it may be appropriate to assess for blood loss. Type 3 injuries occur with double breaks in the bony pelvic ring.

{"id": "article-18452_4_0", "question": "What is the primary function of osteocytes in bones?", "doc_chunk": "Physiology, Bone -- Function -- Bone Cells. Osteocytes - Mechanosensing Cells: These account for 90% of all bone cells. They are derived from osteoblasts. They reside within the bone network known as the lacuna canalicular system. They do not normally express alkaline phosphatase but do express osteocalcin and other bone matrix proteins. They maintain a connection with each other and bone surfaces via their cytoplasmic processes. Osteocytes are linked metabolically and electrically through gap junctions. Their primary function is mechanosensation. Osteocytes detect mechanical loading through physical deformation of bone matrix and fluid flow shear stress resulting from the flow of canalicular fluid through the lacuna canalicular network. Osteocytes act as orchestrators of bone remodeling and as a result, are also considered endocrine cells. They secrete FGF23 to regulate serum phosphate levels. FGF23 decreases renal and intestinal sodium and phosphate co-transporter expression and subsequently increases renal phosphate excretion by both kidneys. [5]", "answer": "Mechanosensation."}

The major movements at the elbow joint are flexion and extension of the forearm (Fig. 7.5A). At the other end of the forearm, the distal end of the lateral bone, the radius, can be flipped over the adjacent head of the medial bone, the ulna. Because the hand is articulated with the radius, it can be efficiently moved from a palm-anterior position to a palm-posterior position simply by crossing the distal end of the radius over the ulna (Fig. 7.5B). This movement, termed pronation, occurs solely in the forearm. Supination returns the hand to the anatomical position. At the wrist joint, the hand can be abducted, adducted, flexed, extended, and circumducted (Fig. 7.6).

Thus an understanding of the unique organization of the various structures between the superciliary arches superiorly, the lower edge of the mandible inferiorly, and as far back as the ears on either side, the area defined as the face, is particularly useful in the practice of medicine. The muscles of the face (Fig. 8.56) develop from the second pharyngeal arch and are innervated by branches of the facial nerve [VII]. They are in the superficial fascia, with origins from either bone or fascia, and insertions into the skin. Because these muscles control expressions of the face, they are sometimes referred to as muscles of “facial expression.” They also act as sphincters and dilators of the orifices of the face (i.e., the orbits, nose, and mouth).

The trachea was deviated. The enlargement of the thyroid gland due to a multinodular goiter may not be symmetrical. In this case there was significant asymmetrical enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid deviating the trachea to the right. The patient had a hoarse voice and noisy breathing. If the thyroid gland enlargement is significant it can compress the trachea, narrowing it to such an extent that a “crowing sound” is heard during inspiration (stridor). Other possible causes for hoarseness include paralysis of the vocal cord due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve from the goiter. Of concern is the possibility of malignant change within the goiter directly invading the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Fortunately, malignant change is rare within the thyroid gland.", "answer": "Malignant change within the thyroid gland can lead to direct invasion and compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, potentially causing vocal cord paralysis and hoarseness."}

In the index, middle, ring, and little fingers, the lumbrical, interossei, and abductor digiti minimi muscles attach to the extensor hoods. In the thumb, the adductor pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis muscles insert into and anchor the extensor hood. Because force from the small intrinsic muscles of the hand is applied to the extensor hood distal to the fulcrum of the metacarpophalangeal joints, the muscles flex these joints (Fig. 7.103B). Simultaneously, the force is transferred dorsally through the hood to extend the interphalangeal joints. This ability to flex the metacarpophalangeal joints, while at the same time extending the interphalangeal joints, is entirely due to the intrinsic muscles of the hand working through the extensor hoods.

Others are against reclassification, arguing that the results only indicate that the neurons are spinal in origin (Neuhuber W et al. Anat Rec 2017;300:1369-1370). In addition, sacral nerves do not enter the sympathetic trunk, nor do they have postganglionic fibers that travel to the periphery on spinal nerves, as do T1-L2 visceral motor fibers.

The 12 pairs of cranial nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and pass through foramina or fissures in the cranial cavity. All nerves except one, the accessory nerve [XI], originate from the brain. In addition to having somatic and visceral components similar to those of spinal nerves, some cranial nerves also contain special sensory and motor components (Tables 8.4 and 8.5). The special sensory components are associated with hearing, seeing, smelling, balancing, and tasting. Special motor components include those that innervate skeletal muscles derived embryologically from the pharyngeal arches and not from somites. In human embryology, six pharyngeal arches are designated, but the fifth pharyngeal arch never develops. Each of the pharyngeal arches that does develop is associated with a developing cranial nerve or one of its branches. These cranial nerves carry efferent fibers that innervate the musculature derived from the pharyngeal arch.", "answer": "Hearing, seeing, smelling, balancing, and tasting."}

{"id": "article-17156_16_0", "question": "What plays a principal role in the initial cell recruitment during the formation of atherosclerosis?", "doc_chunk": "Acute Inflammatory Response -- Clinicopathologic Correlations -- Cardiovascular Disease and Acute Inflammation. Cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, are recognized as the most common cause of death worldwide. During the formation of atherosclerosis, the inflammatory mediators play a principal role in the initial cell recruitment until the rupture of the plaque. Cardiac stress, due to any reason, will first appear as inflammation.  In affected cardiac tissues, there are elevated levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines synthesis and release. In cardiac injury, the most immediate defense mechanism against any cardiac tissue damage is innate immunity. Coronary atherosclerosis is the most common cause of myocardial infarction that results in cardiac tissue loss. In myocardial infarction, as the cardiac cells die and become necrotic, the inflammatory cells would start to come to the site of the necrotic tissue to clear the dead cells and debris. Cell death is the inducer that triggers the acute inflammation process resulting in the release of endogenous signals recognized as a danger signal. Subsequently, the TLRs-mediated pathways trigger inflammatory responses by activating the NF-kB pathway. Next, the chemokines recruit the leukocytes to the areas of the infarct, and the cytokines allow the adhesion between leukocytes and endothelial cells. TGF-B and IL-10 promote cardiac repair by suppressing inflammation. [7]", "answer": "Inflammatory mediators."}

{"id": "article-21960_6_2", "question": "What is another useful clinical test to evaluate the perfusion of the distal extremity in a patient with an Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Flap?", "doc_chunk": "Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Flap -- Anatomy and Physiology. A variety of clinical tests can be performed to assess the viability of the distal extremity on ulnar arterial flow alone. [10] [11] [12] The simplest is the Allen test: the hand is elevated and clenched for 30 seconds, then the radial and ulnar arteries are compressed. The palm of the hand is opened and should appear blanched. Ulnar artery compression is released (while maintaining radial artery compression), and the palm of the hand is assessed for a speedy return of color. If the palm of the hand, thenar eminence, and fingers return to their natural color within 5 seconds, it suggests that the palmar arch is complete and the hand can survive on ulnar arterial flow only. A more sophisticated test would be to perform an Allen test with an oximeter on the thumb (most distal from the ulnar artery) to assess the waveform after the release of ulnar artery compression. If the waveform on the oximeter is dampened or delayed after the ulnar artery release, it may suggest an incomplete arch. Another useful test is an upper extremity Doppler study with compression of the radial and ulnar arteries. If raising an OCRFFF poses an ischemic threat to the distal extremity, an alternative reconstruction should be considered.", "answer": "Upper extremity Doppler study."}

Anatomical knowledge of this region of the chest explains why the wire broke. Many patients have cardiac pacemakers. A wire arises from the pacemaker, which lies within the subcutaneous tissue over the pectoralis major muscle and travels from the pacemaker under the skin to pierce the axillary vein just beneath the clavicle, lateral to the subclavius muscle. The wire then passes through the subclavian vein, the brachiocephalic vein, the superior vena cava, and the right atrium, and lies on the wall of the right ventricle (where it can stimulate the heart to contract) (eFig. 3.118). If the wire pierces the axillary vein directly adjacent to the subclavius muscle, it is possible that after many years of shoulder movement the subclavius muscle stresses and breaks the wire, causing the pacemaker to fail.

Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1020_0", "question": "How many coccygeal vertebrae does the coccyx consist of?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The small terminal part of the vertebral column is the coccyx, which consists of four fused coccygeal vertebrae (Fig. 5.22) and, like the sacrum, has the shape of an inverted triangle. The base of the coccyx is directed superiorly. The superior surface bears a facet for articulation with the sacrum and two horns, or cornua, one on each side, that project upward to articulate or fuse with similar downward-projecting cornua from the sacrum. These processes are modified superior and inferior articular processes that are present on other vertebrae. Each lateral surface of the coccyx has a small rudimentary transverse process, extending from the first coccygeal vertebra. Vertebral arches are absent from coccygeal vertebrae; therefore no bony vertebral canal is present in the coccyx.", "answer": "4"}
{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_662_0", "question": "What is the round ligament of the uterus derived from in the fetus?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray.

In the clinic Normally, only a tiny amount of fluid is present between the visceral and parietal layers of the serous pericardium. In certain situations, this space can be filled with excess fluid (pericardial effusion) (Fig. 3.62). Because the fibrous pericardium is a “relatively fixed” structure that cannot expand easily, a rapid accumulation of excess fluid within the pericardial sac compresses the heart (cardiac tamponade), resulting in biventricular failure. Removing the fluid with a needle inserted into the pericardial sac can relieve the symptoms. In the clinic", "answer": "A rapid accumulation of excess fluid in the pericardial sac leads to biventricular failure because the fibrous pericardium, being a relatively fixed structure, cannot expand easily.

In the clinic Fracture of the scaphoid and avascular necrosis of the proximal scaphoid The commonest carpal injury is a fracture across the waist of the scaphoid bone (Fig. 7.96). It is uncommon to see other injuries. In approximately 10% of individuals, the scaphoid bone has a sole blood supply from the radial artery, which enters through the distal portion of the bone to supply the proximal portion. When a fracture occurs across the waist of the scaphoid, the proximal portion therefore undergoes avascular necrosis. It is impossible to predict which patients have this blood supply.", "answer": "The dual blood supply to the hand allows surgeons to tie off either the radial or ulnar artery without significant consequence when dealing with injuries, as the other artery can still provide sufficient blood flow to the hand."}

The triangular area enclosed by the pectineal line, the gluteal tuberosity, and the intertrochanteric crest is the posterior surface of the proximal end of the femur. The hip joint is a synovial articulation between the head of the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvic bone (Fig. 6.30A). The joint is a multiaxial ball and socket joint designed for stability and weight-bearing at the expense of mobility. Movements at the joint include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and circumduction. When considering the effects of muscle action on the hip joint, the long neck of the femur and the angulation of the neck on the shaft of the femur must be borne in mind. For example, medial and lateral rotation of the femur involves muscles that move the greater trochanter forward and backward, respectively, relative to the acetabulum (Fig. 6.30B).", "answer": "Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial rotation, lateral rotation, and circumduction."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2364_2", "question": "Which artery descends from the maxillary artery to enter the mandibular foramen and canal?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The middle meningeal artery is the largest of the meningeal vessels and supplies much of the dura mater, bone, and related bone marrow of the cranial cavity walls. Within the cranial cavity, the middle meningeal artery and its branches travel in the periosteal (outer) layer of dura mater, which is tightly adherent to the bony walls. As major branches of the middle meningeal artery pass superiorly up the walls of the cranial cavity, they can be damaged by lateral blows to the head. When the vessels are torn, the leaking blood, which is under arterial pressure, slowly separates the dura mater from its attachment to the bone, resulting in an extradural hematoma. The inferior alveolar artery descends from the maxillary artery to enter the mandibular foramen and canal with the inferior alveolar nerve (Fig. 8.151).

{"id": "article-23295_7_2", "question": "What are the primary factors responsible for orthostatic hypotension as explained in the paragraph?", "doc_chunk": "Hypotension -- Etiology. Where L equals the length of the vessel and n equals the viscosity of blood. Functionally, vessel length is not subject to change in the body and viscosity does not rapidly adjust and can be accepted as standard value in most cases. Therefore, the only modifiable physiological value is the radius of the vessel. A decrease in arteriolar caliber increases the resistance to blood flow, thus increasing blood pressure. Conversely, increasing the diameter of terminal arterioles will decrease resistance to blood flow, thus decreasing blood pressure. Total peripheral vascular resistance is primarily controlled via autonomic neuronal responses to modulate fluctuations in blood pressure. The natural state for arteriolar smooth muscle tone is to be relaxed with dilated arterioles. Therefore, the absence or blunting of autonomic input by medications or disease states will lead to hypotension. In orthostatic hypotension, a combination of the blunting of the autonomic nervous system and mild hypovolemia from dehydration is the culprit. When lying flat, there is even distribution of fluid throughout the body. However, on standing heart rate fails to increase appropriately and peripheral resistance fails to increase appropriately leading to a rapid, transient decrease in blood pressure that improves with postural changes. This is classically symptomatic with dizziness and syncope.", "answer": "The primary factors responsible for orthostatic hypotension are the blunting of the autonomic nervous system and mild hypovolemia from dehydration."}

{"id": "article-23268_5_0", "question": "What stimulates testosterone production in Leydig cells?", "doc_chunk": "Hypogonadism -- Pathophysiology. Testosterone production by testicular Leydig cells depends on stimulation from the anterior pituitary gland which secretes pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) into the circulation. When LH binds to its receptors on Leydig cells, it causes cAMP levels to rise. Increased levels of cAMP drives the expression of two proteins: StAR (the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and CYP11A1 (the cholesterol sidechain clevage enzyme). StAR promotes the transfer of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane while CYP11A1 promotes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. Pregnenolone can undergo 17 alpha-hydroxylation to 17 OH pregnenolone which is converted to DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone [8] . DHEA is then converted into androstenediol in order to make testosterone.  Primary hypogonadism is when the testicular steroidogenesis is insufficient to synthesis adequate levels of testosterone while secondary hypogonadism is when signaling to the testis (either from the pituitary, through LH, or from the hypothalamus, through GnRH) is unable to stimulate sufficient Leydig cell testosterone production.", "answer": "Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates testosterone production in Leydig cells."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_556_2", "question": "How does a blocked left coronary artery impact the heart's function?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The patient was breathless because his left ventricular function was poor. When the left ventricle fails, it produces two effects. First, the contractile force is reduced. This reduces the pressure of the ejected blood and lowers the blood pressure. The left atrium has to work harder to fill the failing left ventricle. This extra work increases left atrial pressure, which is reflected in an increased pressure in the pulmonary veins, and this subsequently creates a higher pulmonary venular pressure. This rise in pressure will cause fluid to leak from the capillaries into the pulmonary interstitium and then into the alveoli. Such fluid is called pulmonary edema and it markedly restricts gas exchange. This results in shortness of breath. This man had a blocked left coronary artery, as shown in Fig. 3.114B.

Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic man-made antibiotic that was discovered in 1947. Initially designed for the treatment of typhoid fever, it has fallen out of favor due to the ubiquity of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella typhi . It was also historically used for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients presenting with petechial rash and fever for its excellent coverage of meningococcal sepsis and rickettsial disease. Due to its low-cost, wide spectrum of coverage, and low incidence of toxicity, chloramphenicol has been added to the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines , and the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance to current broad-spectrum antibiotics has brought back interest in its use worldwide. Twelve years after its discovery, the first case report of a potentially fatal adverse reaction to chloramphenicol was discovered in neonates, with a predilection towards preterm infants. Neonates born at less than 37 weeks gestation were given chloramphenicol in an intravenous or oral formulation within two days of birth when they began to develop abdominal distention, vomiting, hypothermia, cyanosis, and cardiovascular instability.

In the clinic The importance of fascias A fascia is a thin band of tissue that surrounds muscles, bones, organs, nerves, and blood vessels and often remains uninterrupted as a 3D structure between tissues. It provides important support for tissues and can provide a boundary between structures. Clinically, fascias are extremely important because they often limit the spread of infection and malignant disease. When infections or malignant diseases cross a fascial plain, a primary surgical clearance may require a far more extensive dissection to render the area free of tumor or infection. A typical example of the clinical importance of a fascial layer would be of that covering the psoas muscle.

Indeed, with detailed knowledge of the segments, curative surgery can be performed in patients with tumor metastases. The liver is divided by the principal plane, which divides the organ into halves of approximately equal size. This imaginary line is defined by a parasagittal line that passes through the gallbladder fossa to the inferior vena cava. It is in this plane that the middle hepatic vein is found. Importantly, the principal plane divides the left half of the liver from the right half. The lobes of the liver are unequal in size and bear only little relevance to operative anatomy. The traditional eight-segment anatomy of the liver relates to the hepatic arterial, portal, and biliary drainage of these segments (Fig. 4.116). The caudate lobe is defined as segment I, and the remaining segments are numbered in a clockwise fashion up to segment VIII. The features are extremely consistent between individuals.", "answer": "The principal plane divides the liver into the left and right halves."}

The diaphragm is formed from four structures— the septum transversum, the posterior esophageal mesentery, the pleuroperitoneal membrane, and the peripheral rim—which eventually fuse together, separating the abdominal cavity from the thoracic cavity. The septum transversum forms the central tendon, which develops from a mesodermal origin superior to the embryo’s head and then moves to its more adult position during folding of the cephalic portion of the embryo. Fusion of the various components of the diaphragm may fail, and hernias may occur through the failed points of fusion (Fig. 4.146).

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2968_2", "question": "Where do fibers entering the cerebellum proceed as, forming synapses with dendrites of granule cells?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Functionally, the cerebellar cortex can be divided into three areas. The vermis in the midline influences movements along the axis of the body, including the neck, trunk, abdomen, and pelvis (eFig. 9.66). Adjacent to the vermis, the intermediate zone controls muscles of the distal upper and lower limbs. The lateral zone participates in motor planning to coordinate sequential movements of the entire body. Input to these functional areas of cerebellar cortex come from the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and brainstem by passing predominantly through the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. Fibers entering the cerebellum proceed as mossy fibers (from various regions) or climbing fibers (from olivary nucleus). Mossy fibers form excitatory synapses with dendrites of the granule cells, in the granule cell layer (eFig. 9.67). From here, the granule cells send axons to the molecular layer, where they bifurcate into parallel fibers that run longitudinally in the folia. The parallel fibers", "answer": "Mossy fibers."}

{"id": "article-21960_39_2", "question": "How can surgeons reduce complications and length of hospitalization in osteocutaneous radial forearm flap procedures?", "doc_chunk": "Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Flap -- Complications. As with all microvascular procedures, flap failure at the microvascular level is the most concerning complication. Surgeon experience, operative technique, and vessel geometry are important factors that contribute to success or failure. Flap failure can be arterial or venous in nature. Situations in which vessel geometry may lead to kinking, obstruction, or excessive tension should be avoided. Thoughtful flap inset is particularly important when mucosal incisions are being sealed to avoid the effects of a potential salivary fistula on the microvascular anastomosis. However, even in the setting of a smooth, well-scripted surgical procedure, there are many patient and patient care factors that can contribute to a failed free flap intraoperatively and/or postoperatively. Identifying those factors and avoiding them is key to reducing complications and length of hospitalization. Early recognition of flap failure may also salvage a compromised flap; otherwise, secondary or replacement reconstruction may be necessary. In a study by Mirzabeigi et al., they reviewed a series of 2260 microvascular flaps with a 3% take-back rate for delayed microvascular compromise, and had a 49% salvage rate.

{"id": "article-22074_15_1", "question": "How does the extent of the stricture influence the dilation process for gastric outlet obstruction?", "doc_chunk": "Gastric Outlet Obstruction -- Treatment / Management -- Benign Mechanical Obstruction. Endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) was introduced in the 1980s, and prior to this, GOO was managed with a surgical approach. [3] First, endoscopy is done to visualize the ulcer in the narrowed portion of the stomach or duodenum. A water-soluble contrast study can be done to help identify the anatomy prior to intervention. Once a stricture is visualized, endoscopic balloon dilation is performed. A balloon dilator is inserted through the working channel of the scope, or a balloon is placed over a guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance. The extent of the stricture determines the amount of dilation. Generally, narrow strictures will require a stepwise dilation, which is carried out over several sessions. After adequate progress, these sessions become less frequent. [1] For example, strictures caused by caustic injury generally have a smaller diameter and require more dilatations. There is a higher percentage of caustic strictures refractory to EBD compared to noncaustic strictures. The rates of perforation are higher in caustic strictures compared to strictures from peptic ulcer disease. Caustic ingestion causes deeper damage to the tissue in contact resulting in fibrosis, making it more challenging to manage with EBD. [3] EBD is successful in the short term and almost instant symptom improvement is seen. It may be beneficial to postpone dilation beyond 15 mm until after a period with medical management. After a sufficient dilation is reached, sustained clinical response is seen in around 70% to 80% of patients. [1] The predictors of failure of EBD include caustic causes of strictures, multiple, long, or tortuous strictures. [3] If the stricture is refractory to dilation, stent placement with or without surgery should be considered.

The most common of all congenital heart defects are those that occur in the ventricular septum—ventriculoseptal defect (VSD). These lesions are most frequent in the membranous portion of the septum and they allow blood to flow from the left ventricle (higher pressure) to the right ventricle (lower pressure), leading to an abnormal communication between the systemic and pulmonary circulation. This leads to right ventricular hypertrophy, increased pulmonary blood flow, elevated arterial pulmonary pressure, and increased blood volume returning to the left ventricle, causing its dilation. Increased pulmonary pressure in most severe cases may cause pulmonary edema. If large enough and left untreated, VSDs can produce marked clinical problems that might require surgery.

[10] [11] [12] The simplest is the Allen test: the hand is elevated and clenched for 30 seconds, then the radial and ulnar arteries are compressed. The palm of the hand is opened and should appear blanched. Ulnar artery compression is released (while maintaining radial artery compression), and the palm of the hand is assessed for a speedy return of color. If the palm of the hand, thenar eminence, and fingers return to their natural color within 5 seconds, it suggests that the palmar arch is complete and the hand can survive on ulnar arterial flow only. A more sophisticated test would be to perform an Allen test with an oximeter on the thumb (most distal from the ulnar artery) to assess the waveform after the release of ulnar artery compression. If the waveform on the oximeter is dampened or delayed after the ulnar artery release, it may suggest an incomplete arch.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1032_1", "question": "What muscle's tendon passes through the lesser sciatic foramen?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The lesser sciatic foramen is formed by the lesser sciatic notch of the pelvic bone, the ischial spine, the sacrospinous ligament, and the sacrotuberous ligament (Fig. 5.31). The tendon of the obturator internus muscle passes through this foramen to enter the gluteal region of the lower limb. Because the lesser sciatic foramen is positioned below the attachment of the pelvic floor, it acts as a route of communication between the perineum and the gluteal region. The pudendal nerve and internal pudendal vessels pass between the pelvic cavity (above the pelvic floor) and the perineum (below the pelvic floor), by first passing out of the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen and then looping around the ischial spine and sacrospinous ligament to pass through the lesser sciatic foramen to enter the perineum. The nerve to obturator internus follows a similar course.", "answer": "Obturator internus."}
{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1239_1", "question": "How does age impact the likelihood of experiencing generalized erectile dysfunction (ED)", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a complex condition in which men are unable to initiate or maintain penile erection. When this affects erections during sleep, and with self-stimulation as well as with a partner, vascular and/or nerve impairment is present. This generalized type of ED increases with age and is recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is frequently associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurological conditions including Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and as nerve damage from pelvic surgeries or radiation for pelvic malignancies. Low testosterone states can impair erections and consistently prevent sleep-induced erections. Medications including serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), thiazides and anti-androgens can also underlie ED. When only partnered erections are problematic, psychological factors underlie the dysfunction—the normal erections from sleep confirming healthy vascular and neurological", "answer": "Increases."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_861_2", "question": "Why does intraabdominal infection tend to stay below the diaphragm instead of spreading to other body cavities?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Peritoneal spread of disease The large surface area of the peritoneal cavity allows infection and malignant disease to spread easily throughout the abdomen (Fig. 4.57). If malignant cells enter the peritoneal cavity by direct invasion (e.g., from colon or ovarian cancer), spread may be rapid. Similarly, a surgeon excising a malignant tumor and releasing malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity may cause an appreciable worsening of the patient’s prognosis. Infection can also spread across the large surface area. The peritoneal cavity can also act as a barrier to, and container of, disease. Intraabdominal infection therefore tends to remain below the diaphragm rather than spread into other body cavities.", "answer": "Intraabdominal infection tends to stay below the diaphragm because the peritoneal cavity acts as a barrier and container of disease, preventing the spread to other body cavities."}

The procedure is performed in the operating room, with anesthesia providing sedation, and some surgeons may prefer general anesthesia. The patient is placed either in a prone or lithotomy position depending on the anticipated tract and its source anterior or posterior in the anus. If the anticipated tract is anterior in the anus, then prone is preferred and the lithotomy position for the posterior midline tracts. This positioning makes the internal opening more visible for the surgeon and the tract more accessible. The fistula probe (lacrimal duct probes) are usually required to explore the tract and its trajector, and most of the time, with chronic fistulas, the probe can be used to find the internal opening easily. If the tract is difficult to locate, then hydrogen peroxide can be injected gently in the external opening (utilizing the syringe with angiocatheter to enter the external opening), and with an anal retractor, the peroxide can be seen bubbling from the internal opening. This maneuver allows the surgeon to demonstrate where the tract would be using the probe. [9] Once the tract has the probe through it, then a vessel loop, a heavy 1 nylon suture, or a thick rubber band can be attached to the probe and brought through the tract. Both ends of the Seton are sewn together in a couple of areas close together, so the loop to prevent it from falling out. If a cutting seton is selected, then the Seton is gradually tightened externally over weeks. If a non-cutting seton is utilized, the Seton is usually fashioned from a vessel loop or other smooth non-reactive product and left loose. If the tract cannot be located, the surgeon should not force a tract at the risk of creating a false tract. If the tract cannot be located, the surgeon may work to unroof the external opening as close to the anal verge as possible and make plans for a repeat anorectal examination under anesthesia in the operating room in the following weeks. In the meantime, the surgeon may opt for a CT scan or MRI of the pelvis with rectal contrast to see if the tract can be identified. The surgeon may use local anesthesia for postoperative pain management. Perineal dressings are then applied. The surgeon should dictate a meticulous operative note as to the depth of the tract, the site of internal and external openings as well as the plan for the Seton.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1723_1", "question": "Where does the trapezius muscle have its origin from the axial skeleton?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Deep to the trapezius the scapula is attached to the vertebral column by three muscles—the levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major. These three muscles work with the trapezius (and with muscles found anteriorly) to position the scapula on the trunk. The trapezius muscle has an extensive origin from the axial skeleton, which includes sites on the skull and the vertebrae, from CI to TXII (Fig. 7.36). From CI to CVII, the muscle attaches to the vertebrae through the ligamentum nuchae. The muscle inserts onto the skeletal framework of the shoulder along the inner margins of a continuous U-shaped line of attachment oriented in the horizontal plane, with the bottom of the U directed laterally. Together, the left and right trapezius muscles form a diamond or trapezoid shape, from which the name is derived.

Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well. [1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot.

The patient’s blood pressure began to increase. Within the skull there is a fixed volume and clearly what goes in must come out (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid). If there is a space-occupying lesion, such as an extradural hematoma, there is no space into which it can decompress. As the lesion expands, the brain becomes compressed and the intracranial pressure increases. This pressure compresses vessels, so lowering the cerebral perfusion pressure. To combat this the homeostatic mechanisms of the body increase the blood pressure to overcome the increase in intracerebral pressure. Unfortunately, the increase in intracranial pressure is compounded by the cerebral edema that occurs at and after the initial insult.

If the lump is reducible, the hand should be withdrawn and careful observation will reveal recurrence of the mass. The position of an abnormal mass in the groin relative to the pubic tubercle is very important, as are the presence of increased temperature and pain, which may represent early signs of strangulation or infection. As a general rule: An inguinal hernia appears through the superficial inguinal ring above the pubic tubercle and crest. A femoral hernia (see below) appears through the femoral canal below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.", "answer": "Non-reducible means that the abnormal mass in the scrotum cannot be pushed back into place or made smaller by applying pressure."}

The plantar aponeurosis supports the longitudinal arch of the foot and protects deeper structures in the sole. Fibrous sheaths of toes The tendons of the flexor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum brevis, and flexor hallucis longus muscles enter fibrous digital sheaths or tunnels on the plantar aspect of the digits (Fig. 6.116). These fibrous sheaths begin anterior to the metatarsophalangeal joints and extend to the distal phalanges. They are formed by fibrous arches and cruciate (cross-shaped) ligaments attached posteriorly to the margins of the phalanges and to the plantar ligaments associated with the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. These fibrous tunnels hold the tendons to the bony plane and prevent tendon bowing when the toes are flexed. Within each tunnel, the tendons are surrounded by a synovial sheath.", "answer": "Fibrous sheaths in the foot help prevent tendon bowing by holding the tendons close to the bony plane, ensuring they do not bow out when the toes are flexed."}
{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2525_0", "question": "What is the function of the laryngeal saccule in the larynx?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. On each side, the mucosa of the middle cavity bulges laterally through the gap between the vestibular and vocal ligaments to produce an expanded trough-shaped space (a laryngeal ventricle) (Fig. 8.221A). An elongate tubular extension of each ventricle (laryngeal saccule) projects anterosuperiorly between the vestibular fold and thyroid cartilage and may reach as high as the top of the thyroid cartilage. Within the walls of these laryngeal saccules are numerous mucous glands. Mucus secreted into the saccules lubricates the vocal folds. When viewed from above (Fig. 8.221C,D), there is a triangular opening (the rima vestibuli) between the two adjacent vestibular folds at the entrance to the middle chamber of the laryngeal cavity. The apex of the opening is anterior and its base is formed by the posterior wall of the laryngeal cavity.", "answer": "The function of the laryngeal saccule is to lubricate the vocal folds."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2534_1", "question": "Which muscles are responsible for rotating the arytenoid cartilages laterally during forced inspiration?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. During quiet respiration, the laryngeal inlet, vestibule, rima vestibuli, and rima glottidis are open. The arytenoid cartilages are abducted and the rima glottidis is triangular shaped (Fig. 8.225A). During forced inspiration (Fig. 8.225B), the arytenoid cartilages are rotated laterally, mainly by the action of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscles. As a result, the vocal folds are abducted and the rima glottidis widens into a rhomboid shape, which effectively increases the diameter of the laryngeal airway. When phonating, the arytenoid cartilages and vocal folds are adducted and air is forced through the closed rima glottidis (Fig. 8.225C). This action causes the vocal folds to vibrate against each other and produce sounds, which can then be modified by the upper parts of the airway and oral cavity. Tension in the vocal folds can be adjusted by the vocalis and cricothyroid muscles.", "answer": "posterior crico-arytenoid muscles."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2521_0", "question": "How does the forward movement and downward rotation of the thyroid cartilage affect the vocal ligaments?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Because the vocal ligaments pass between the posterior aspect of the thyroid angle and the arytenoid cartilages that sit on the lamina of cricoid cartilage, forward movement and downward rotation of the thyroid cartilage on the cricoid cartilage effectively lengthens and puts tension on the vocal ligaments. The crico-arytenoid joints between articular facets on the superolateral surfaces of the cricoid cartilage and the bases of the arytenoid cartilages enable the arytenoid cartilages to slide away or toward each other and to rotate so that the vocal processes pivot either toward or away from the midline. These movements abduct and adduct the vocal ligaments (Fig. 8.220). Cavity of the larynx The central cavity of the larynx (Fig. 8.221) is tubular and lined by mucosa.

High-density contrast medium is ingested to opacify the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. As described previously (p. 6), the bowel is insufflated with air (or carbon dioxide) to provide a double-contrast study. In many countries, endoscopy has superseded upper gastrointestinal imaging, but the mainstay of imaging the large bowel is the double-contrast barium enema. Typically the patient needs to undergo bowel preparation, in which powerful cathartics are used to empty the bowel. At the time of the examination a small tube is placed into the rectum and a barium suspension is run into the large bowel. The patient undergoes a series of twists and turns so that the contrast passes through the entire large bowel. The contrast is emptied and air is passed through the same tube to insufflate the large bowel. A thin layer of barium coats the normal mucosa, allowing mucosal detail to be visualized (see Fig. 1.4).", "answer": "Bowel preparation is necessary to empty the bowel, allowing for effective imaging and detailed visualization of the large bowel's mucosa."}

{"id": "article-18382_7_1", "question": "What is the composition of the posterior lamella of the lower eyelid?", "doc_chunk": "Transconjunctival Blepharoplasty -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Applied Anatomy. The lower eyelid is supported medially by the medial canthal tendon and laterally by the lateral canthal tendon. At the tarsal plate level, the eyelid has a bi-lamellar structure with an anterior lamella of skin and orbicularis muscle with a suborbicularis fascial plane with minimal fat. The posterior lamella comprises the tarsus (which measures 1 mm in thickness and 5 to 6 mm in height) and conjunctiva. Below the level of the tarsal plate, the eyelid may be considered as having a tri-lamella structure with anterior lamella consisting of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle, the middle lamella comprising of the orbital septum, and to a degree, the lower eyelid retractors (called the capsulopalpebral fascia) with fat interposed between the septum and the retractors. At the orbital rim, the orbital septum fuses with the periosteum creating what is called the arcus marginalis.  The posterior lamella may be considered as consisting of, to a degree, the lower eyelid retractors and the conjunctiva. The lower eyelid retractors are analogous to the upper eyelid retractors (levator palpebrae superioris and its aponeurosis): the lower lid retractors arise from the inferior rectus muscle, envelope the inferior oblique muscle, and proceed to insert into the inferior border of the tarsal plate and orbital septum.  Like the levator palpebrae, the lower lid retractors are supplied by the oculomotor nerve. The equivalent of Muller's muscle (innervated by the sympathetic fibers originating from the carotid plexus) is a less defined muscle present just behind the capsulopalpebral fascia, often called the inferior tarsal smooth muscle. Similar to the Whitnall's ligament in the upper eyelid, Lockwood's ligament (the suspensory ligamentous sling supporting the globe) is attached laterally to the Whitnall's tubercle and inferolateral orbital rim and medially to the inferomedial orbital rim. Analogous to the upper eyelid post-levator aponeurosis fat pad, the lower eyelid has two additional thin layers of fat, the inter-lower eyelid retractor fat pad lying between the two layers of the lower eyelid retractors and the post-lower eyelid retractor fat pad lying between this and the conjunctiva. Whitnall’s tubercle is 3 to 4 mm inside the orbital rim and just above the horizontal axis.

Neurons in the enteric system are derived from neural crest cells originally associated with occipitocervical and sacral regions. Interestingly, more neurons are reported to be in the enteric system than in the spinal cord itself. Sensory and motor neurons within the enteric system control reflex activity within and between parts of the gastrointestinal system. These reflexes regulate peristalsis, secretomotor activity, and vascular tone. These activities can occur independently of the brain and spinal cord, but can also be modified by input from preganglionic parasympathetic and postganglionic sympathetic fibers. Sensory information from the enteric system is carried back to the CNS by visceral sensory fibers. Nerve plexuses are either somatic or visceral and combine fibers from different sources or levels to form new nerves with specific targets or destinations (Fig. 1.49).

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1976_1", "question": "How is the axillary nerve at risk of injury during an anteroinferior dislocation?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Anterior dislocation (Fig. 7.32) occurs most frequently and is usually associated with an isolated traumatic incident (clinically, all anterior dislocations are anteroinferior). In some cases, the anteroinferior glenoid labrum is torn with or without a small bony fragment. Once the joint capsule and cartilage are disrupted, the joint is susceptible to further (recurrent) dislocations. When an anteroinferior dislocation occurs, the axillary nerve may be injured by direct compression of the humeral head on the nerve inferiorly as it passes through the quadrangular space. Furthermore, the “lengthening” effect of the humerus may stretch the radial nerve, which is tightly bound within the radial groove, and produce a radial nerve paralysis.

It is important to test the nerves that supply the arm and hand, although this is extremely difficult to do in an unconscious patient. However, some muscle reflexes can be determined using a tendon hammer. Also, it may be possible to test for pain reflexes in patients with altered consciousness levels. Palpation of the axillary artery, brachial artery, radial artery, and ulnar artery pulses is necessary because a fracture of the first rib can sever and denude the subclavian artery, which passes over it. A chest drain was immediately inserted because the lung had collapsed. The fractured first rib had damaged the visceral and parietal pleurae, allowing air from a torn lung to escape into the pleural cavity. The lung collapsed, and the pleural cavity filled with air, which impaired lung function.

Fortunately, most of the other portosystemic anastomoses are of relatively little consequence. In patients with colostomies, small veins may develop between the veins of the large bowel (portal system drainage) and cutaneous veins on the anterior abdominal wall (systemic veins). If these veins become enlarged because of portal hypertension, they are subject to trauma as feces are passed through the colostomy. Torrential hemorrhage may ensue if they are damaged. A procedure was carried out to lower the portal pressure. To reduce the pressure in the portal vein in this patient, several surgical procedures were considered. These included sewing the side of the portal vein onto the inferior vena cava (portacaval shunt) and sewing the splenic vein onto the renal vein (a splenorenal shunt). These procedures, however, require a large abdominal incision and are extremely complex.

The joint between the body of the sternum and the xiphoid process often becomes ossified with age. A clinically useful feature of the manubriosternal joint is that it can be palpated easily. This is because the manubrium normally angles posteriorly on the body of the sternum, forming a raised feature referred to as the sternal angle. This elevation marks the site of articulation of rib II with the sternum. Rib I is not palpable, because it lies inferior to the clavicle and is embedded in tissues at the base of the neck.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_196_0", "question": "What is the spinal pia mater's relationship with the spinal cord?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The spinal pia mater is a vascular membrane that firmly adheres to the surface of the spinal cord (Fig. 2.59). It extends into the anterior median fissure and reflects as sleeve-like coatings onto posterior and anterior rootlets and roots as they cross the subarachnoid space. As the roots exit the space, the sleeve-like coatings reflect onto the arachnoid mater. On each side of the spinal cord, a longitudinally oriented sheet of pia mater (the denticulate ligament) extends laterally from the cord toward the arachnoid and dura mater (Fig. 2.59). Medially, each denticulate ligament is attached to the spinal cord in a plane that lies between the origins of the posterior and anterior rootlets. Laterally, each denticulate ligament forms a series of triangular extensions along its free border, with the apex of each extension being anchored through the arachnoid mater to the dura mater.", "answer": "The spinal pia mater is closely attached to the spinal cord, extending into its structures and providing a protective and supportive coating as it transitions into the arachnoid mater."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1439_0", "question": "How is the calf muscle identified in the upper leg?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. In the upper leg, the heads of the gastrocnemius combine to form a single elongate muscle belly, which forms much of the soft tissue bulge identified as the calf. In the lower leg, the muscle fibers of the gastrocnemius converge with those of the deeper soleus muscle to form the calcaneal tendon, which attaches to the calcaneus (heel) of the foot. The gastrocnemius plantarflexes the foot at the ankle joint and can also flex the leg at the knee joint. It is innervated by the tibial nerve. The plantaris has a small muscle belly proximally and a long thin tendon, which descends through the leg and joins the calcaneal tendon (Fig. 6.87).

The typical site for compression of the suprascapular nerve is the suprascapular notch (foramen) on the superior margin of the scapula. The patient’s apparently minor injury damaged the fibrocartilaginous glenoid labrum, which allowed a cyst to form and pass along the superior border of the scapula to the suprascapular notch (foramen), where the cyst compressed the suprascapular nerve. Surgical excision of the damaged glenoid labrum and removal of the cyst improved the patient’s symptoms.", "answer": "Denervation due to nerve transection, compression, or pharmacological effects."}
{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2890_2", "question": "How are the parietal and occipital lobes demarcated along the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Structurally, each cerebral hemisphere is divided into four major anatomical lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal (eFig. 9.9A). The frontal lobes are located anteriorly and are separated from the more posterior parietal lobe by the central sulcus (sulcus of Rolando) (eFig. 9.9A). Laterally, the frontal lobe is separated from the temporal lobe by the lateral sulcus (fissure of Sylvius). Although there is no specific demarcation between the parietal and occipital lobe laterally, along the medial aspect of the hemispheres the two lobes are separated by the parieto-occipital sulcus (eFig. 9.9B).

Based on the origin of the anorectal fistula development from cryptoglandular abscesses, the internal opening of most fistulas is located at the dentate line. The type of fistula is most commonly diagnosed at an anorectal examination under anesthesia, where anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy can be performed at the time of fistula tract exploration. The decision of which structures the fistula connection incorporates, i.e., internal and external sphincter complex is important as only a small amount of external sphincter muscle that can be cut. [7] Up to 30% of the external sphincter muscle can be cut without compromising fecal continence. To avoid the cutting of too much external sphincter and to decrease the risk of fecal incontinence as well as to allow adequate drainage following abscess drainage, a Seton can be placed through the tract. Seton can either be utilized to slowly cut through the sphincter muscle over time, called 'cutting Seton.' Setons can also be placed into fistula tracks to allow previously undrained collections to heal around the seton slowly, called a 'non-cutting Seton.' In addition to the depth of the fistula, there are certain clues as to where the fistula tract originates from the location of the external opening. This is from Goodsall's rule, which states that if a transverse line is drawn across the anus, a fistulous external opening which is anterior to this line and will be located internally 3 cm of the anal verge, with the fistulas tract radially and directly into the anal canal. However, if the external opening is posterior to this line or outside of the 3 to 4 cm area from the anal verge, then these fistulas tend to arc around to the posterior midline anal gland. These arching fistula tracts are sometimes difficult to completely discern at the first operation, so the tract can be partially unroofed towards to anal verge being careful to avoid the destruction of the external anal sphincter. Although Goodsall's rule has been taught for years, there are some challenges to this rule recently; however, for simple fistulas, it is a good starting point.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_911_2", "question": "How does liver cirrhosis affect blood clotting?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The liver is responsible for the production of numerous proteins, including those of the clotting cascade. Any disorder of the liver (including infection and cirrhosis) may decrease the production of these proteins and so prevent adequate blood clotting. Patients with severe cirrhosis of the liver have a significant risk of serious bleeding, even from small cuts; in addition, when varices rupture, there is a danger of rapid exsanguination. As the liver progressively fails, the patient develops salt and water retention, which produces skin and subcutaneous edema. Fluid (ascites) is also retained in the peritoneal cavity, which can hold many liters. The poorly functioning liver cells (hepatocytes) are unable to break down blood and blood products, leading to an increase in the serum bilirubin level, which manifests as jaundice.", "answer": "Liver cirrhosis impairs blood clotting by reducing the production of clotting proteins, increasing the risk of serious bleeding."}

There are several diagnostic tests used make the determination of gallbladder disease. A simple abdominal x-ray can be used to identify calcified gallstones. Because only 10% of all gallstones are calcified, this imaging study has limited usefulness. Porcelain gallbladders can also be seen in plain x-rays. This condition is somewhat uncommon and results from calcification of the gallbladder wall. In 1924, two American surgeons developed the oral cholecystogram or OCG. The OCG is done by administering iopanoic acid by mouth. This is an iodine-based material that is absorbed by the intestines and concentrated in the gallbladder. When it combines with bile salts, it becomes a very radio-opaque liquid present within the gallbladder. This will outline any gallstones present in the gallbladder. The intervenous cholangiogram was developed in 1954. It was chiefly used to evaluate the bile ducts and to look for stones or strictures within these bile ducts. An iodine-based dye is injected intravenously. It is then concentrated in the liver and excreted into the bile ducts. The intervenous cholangiogram was a poor test to evaluate the actual gallbladder because sometimes the gallbladder was bypassed entirely as the dye went directly from the bile ducts into the small bowel.

Dermatographism, also known as Dermographism urticaria, or urticaria factitia, is an urticarial eruption upon pressure or trauma to the skin. Urticarial skin reactions present as erythematous wheals in the dermis and can have innumerable causes. Dermatographism is the most common type of inducible/physical urticaria, occurring in approximately 2% to 5% of the population. Downward pressure on the skin produces linear erythematous wheals in the dermis in the shape of the external force applied, earning the name dermatographism, which literally means \"writing on the skin.\" A small subset of people with dermatographism becomes symptomatic with pruritus, stinging, prickling sensations that can be bothersome for the patient.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1741_0", "question": "What are the origins of the clavicular head of the pectoralis major muscle?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The clavicular head originates from the medial half of the clavicle. The sternocostal head originates from the medial part of the anterior thoracic wall—often, fibers from this head continue inferiorly and medially to attach to the anterior abdominal wall, forming an additional abdominal part of the muscle. The muscle inserts into the lateral lip of the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus. The parts of the muscle that have a superior origin on the trunk insert lower and more anteriorly on the lateral lip of the intertubercular sulcus than the parts of the muscle that originate inferiorly. Acting together, the two heads of the pectoralis major flex, adduct, and medially rotate the arm at the glenohumeral joint. The clavicular head flexes the arm from an extended position, whereas the sternocostal head extends the arm from a flexed position, particularly against resistance.", "answer": "The clavicular head of the pectoralis major muscle originates from the medial half of the clavicle."}

The small terminal part of the vertebral column is the coccyx, which consists of four fused coccygeal vertebrae (Fig. 5.22) and, like the sacrum, has the shape of an inverted triangle. The base of the coccyx is directed superiorly. The superior surface bears a facet for articulation with the sacrum and two horns, or cornua, one on each side, that project upward to articulate or fuse with similar downward-projecting cornua from the sacrum. These processes are modified superior and inferior articular processes that are present on other vertebrae. Each lateral surface of the coccyx has a small rudimentary transverse process, extending from the first coccygeal vertebra. Vertebral arches are absent from coccygeal vertebrae; therefore no bony vertebral canal is present in the coccyx.", "answer": "inverted triangle."}

During the operation, a camera known as a laparoscope is used to transmit live, magnified images of the surgical field to a monitor viewed by the surgeon. The camera is inserted into the abdominal cavity through a small incision, called a port-site, usually at the umbilicus. In order to create enough space to operate, the abdominal wall is elevated by inflating the cavity with gas, typically carbon dioxide. Other long, thin surgical instruments are then introduced through additional port-sites, which can be used by the surgeon to operate. The placement of these port-sites is carefully planned to allow optimal access to the surgical field.", "answer": "A laparoscope is used during surgery to transmit live, magnified images of the surgical field to a monitor, allowing the surgeon to view and operate through small incisions."}

Anterior dislocation (Fig. 7.32) occurs most frequently and is usually associated with an isolated traumatic incident (clinically, all anterior dislocations are anteroinferior). In some cases, the anteroinferior glenoid labrum is torn with or without a small bony fragment. Once the joint capsule and cartilage are disrupted, the joint is susceptible to further (recurrent) dislocations. When an anteroinferior dislocation occurs, the axillary nerve may be injured by direct compression of the humeral head on the nerve inferiorly as it passes through the quadrangular space. Furthermore, the “lengthening” effect of the humerus may stretch the radial nerve, which is tightly bound within the radial groove, and produce a radial nerve paralysis.

{"id": "article-17076_59_1", "question": "How does acetaminophen overdose lead to liver intoxication?", "doc_chunk": "Acetaminophen/Aspirin/Caffeine -- Toxicity -- Acetaminophen. In many countries, acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Liver intoxication initiates by metabolizing acetaminophen to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), depleting cellular glutathione and forming protein adducts on mitochondrial proteins; this leads to the activation of the apoptosis cascade. Intoxication differs between the individuals according to some factors, specifically, decreased P53 that shows a protective role in regulating the metabolism of acetaminophen, increased protein kinase (cAMP-dependent) inhibitor alpha, deficiency of interleukin 15, and deficiency of prostaglandin E2. Acetaminophen stimulates Kupffer cells to form peroxynitrite, which is a potent oxidant and leads to the accumulation of neutrophils. Lower acetaminophen (150 mg/kg) causes reversible mitochondrial dysfunction and fat droplet formation in hepatocytes without ALT release or necrosis.", "answer": "Liver intoxication from acetaminophen overdose occurs due to the metabolism of acetaminophen into NAPQI, which depletes glutathione and forms harmful protein adducts on mitochondrial proteins, leading to apoptosis and liver damage."}

Among type 1 and type 2 alcoholics (typologies developed by Cloninger), type 1 alcoholics are characterized by the late onset of problem drinking, the rapid development of behavioral tolerance to alcohol, prominent guilt and anxiety related to drinking, and infrequent fighting and arrests when drinking. Cloninger also termed this subtype “milieu-limited,” which emphasizes the etiologic role of environmental factors. In contrast, type 2 alcoholics are characterized by early onset of an inability to abstain from alcohol, frequent fighting and arrests when drinking, and the absence of guilt and fear concerning drinking. Cloninger postulated that transmission of alcoholism in type 2 alcoholics was from fathers to sons, hence term the male-limited alcoholism. Type 1 alcoholics are characterized by high-reward dependence, high-harm avoidance, and low-novelty seeking. In contrast, type 2 alcoholics are characterized by high-novelty seeking, low-harm avoidance, and low-reward dependence. Cloninger also hypothesized that specific neurotransmitter systems underlie personality structure. Specifically, dopamine is hypothesized to modulate novelty seeking, characterized by frequent exploratory behavior and intensely pleasurable responses to novel stimuli. Serotonin is hypothesized to modulate harm avoidance, which is a tendency to respond intensely to aversive stimuli and their conditioned signals. Finally, norepinephrine is hypothesized to modulate reward dependence or the resistance to extinction of previously rewarded behavior.", "answer": "Cloninger differentiates type 1 and type 2 alcoholics by their onset of drinking problems, behavioral responses to alcohol, and associated guilt and anxiety, as well as their distinct personality traits such as reward dependence, harm avoidance, and novelty seeking."}

Acrokeratoelastoidosis (AKE) of Oswaldo Costa, or inverse papular acrokeratosis , is a rare autosomal-dominant genodermatosis first described in 1952 by Oswaldo Costa, a Brazilian dermatologist. [1] It characteristically presents with flesh-colored papules on the lateral areas of the palms, soles, and dorsum of hands. Acrokeratoelastoidosis is a type of marginal keratoderma that principally affects the lateral portion of the palmoplantar regions [Figures 1 (A) and (B)] . Apart from inherited cases, there are reports of sporadic occurrences of this condition. [2] The histological features are hyalinized and homogenous collagen, hyperkeratosis,  and a decrease in, and fragmentation of the elastic fibers (elastorrhexis). [3] This rare form of focal acral keratoderma of unknown cause typically begins during childhood, although onset may delay until adolescence. As per the limited published literature on this condition, there seems to be no gender or racial predilection. Another reason for some patients seeking a dermatologist's opinion a few years after the onset is the asymptomatic nature of the lesions. The condition requires differentiation from two sets of disorders: 1) other marginal and focal acral keratodermas, and 2) distinct disorders such as acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf. Histopathological findings aid in differentiation between acrokeratoelastoidosis and other clinical simulators. There is no reported morbidity, and apart from cosmetic concerns of some patients, the overall prognosis of AKE is good. [3] [4]", "answer": "childhood or adolescence."}

Unconjugated bilirubin gets accumulated in the plasma. It is eliminated very slowly in small amounts by alternative pathways that consist of direct passage into the bile and small intestine. It cannot be excreted through the urine as it is water-insoluble. These factors contribute to the excessive accumulation of indirect bilirubin in the body resulting in deposition in body tissues such as skin, sclera, brain, etc. At normal physiologic body pH, unconjugated bilirubin binds sufficiently to albumin. But in the absence of conjugation and excretion, the amount of unconjugated bilirubin overwhelms the amount of albumin present in the body. Hence the amount of free (unbound) unconjugated bilirubin rises in the blood. Typically, about 99% of bilirubin is bound to albumin, which doesn't interact with cerebral endothelial. In contrast, free (unbound) unconjugated bilirubin easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and interacts with neural tissue.

How the osteotomies are performed depends upon the surgeon's preference. It is the author's preference to perform right-angle cuts to remove a rectangular block of bone through the distal and proximal limits of the osteotomies, as opposed to a “canoe boat” or “keel-boat” which is often described. When exposing the bone for osteotomy, care is taken to preserve the periosteum over the bone. The length of the bone to be harvested is delineated. The limits of the bone harvest are the head of the radius distally and the insertion of the pronator teres muscle proximally. Roughly 50% of the height of the radius is identified by visual inspection and palpation with the arm pronated and supinated. A scalpel can be used to incise the periosteum and mark the planned osteotomies. Osteotomies can then be made with the saw along the incised periosteum. Care should be taken during the completion of the vertical osteotomies to avoid pass-cutting into the residual radius.  Doing so can weaken the bone that remains after graft harvest. Once the osteotomies are complete, the flap can be elevated out of the forearm, pedicled by the vascular bundle feeding it.", "answer": "Avoid pass-cutting into the residual radius to prevent weakening the remaining bone."}

Femoral neck fractures (Fig. 6.28) can interrupt the blood supply to the femoral head. The blood supply to the head and neck is primarily from an arterial ring formed by the branches of the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries around the base of the femoral neck. From here, vessels course along the neck, penetrate the capsule, and supply the femoral head. The blood supply to the femoral head and femoral neck is further enhanced by the artery of the ligamentum teres, a branch of the obturator artery, which is generally small and variable. Femoral neck fractures may disrupt associated vessels and lead to necrosis of the femoral head. Femoral neck fractures can be divided into three categories depending on the location of the fracture line: subcapital (fracture line passes across the femoral head-neck junction), transcervical (fracture line passes through the midportion of the femoral neck), and basicervical (fracture line passes across the base of the neck).

CCK acts via the vasovagal pathway and is activated peripherally via gastric wall distension. They use intragastric balloons in clinical practice to treat weight loss by mimicking this pathway. By distending the stomach it activates the vagal nerve and the nucleus of tractus solitarius and the paraventricular nucleus, leading to a centrally mediated feeling of satiety. [12] These devices physically reduce food intake by obstructing the outlet, delaying gastric emptying and physically reducing the capacity of the stomach. Pancreatic peptide (PP) secretion is impaired due to decreased gastric emptying which leads to reduced gut wall interactions with nutrients such as fat and protein which elicit a PP response. PP secretion is biphasic, and food and secretion of CCK control the second phase.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2812_1", "question": "Why would a lesion above the motor nucleus result in contralateral lower facial weakness?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. A primary brainstem lesion affecting the motor nucleus of the facial nerve [VII] would lead to ipsilateral (same side) weakness of the whole face. However, because the upper part of the nucleus receives motor input from the left and right cerebral hemispheres a lesion occurring above the nucleus leads to contralateral lower facial weakness. In this example, motor innervation to the upper face is spared because the upper part of the nucleus receives input from both hemispheres. Preservation and loss of the special functions are determined by the extent of the lesion. Lesions at and around the geniculate ganglion Typically lesions at and around the geniculate ganglion are accompanied by loss of motor function on the whole of the ipsilateral (same) side of the face. Taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, lacrimation, and some salivation also are likely to be affected because the lesion is proximal to the greater petrosal and chorda tympani branches of the nerve.", "answer": "A lesion above the motor nucleus results in contralateral lower facial weakness because the upper part of the nucleus, which controls the upper face, receives motor input from both cerebral hemispheres, thus sparing it from unilateral damage. Conversely, the lower part of the nucleus, which controls the lower face, does not receive bilateral input, making it susceptible to contralateral weakness when a lesion occurs above the nucleus."}

The parasympathetic system is more restricted to innervation of the viscera only. Spinal sympathetic and spinal parasympathetic neurons share certain developmental and phenotypic features that are different from those of cranial parasympathetic neurons. Based on this, some researchers have suggested reclassifying all spinal visceral motor neurons as sympathetic (Espinosa-Medina I et al. Science 2016;354:893-897). Others are against reclassification, arguing that the results only indicate that the neurons are spinal in origin (Neuhuber W et al. Anat Rec 2017;300:1369-1370). In addition, sacral nerves do not enter the sympathetic trunk, nor do they have postganglionic fibers that travel to the periphery on spinal nerves, as do T1-L2 visceral motor fibers.

Positioning the hand Unlike the lower limb, which is used for support, stability, and locomotion, the upper limb is highly mobile for positioning the hand in space. The shoulder is suspended from the trunk predominantly by muscles and can therefore be moved relative to the body. Sliding (protraction and retraction) and rotating the scapula on the thoracic wall changes the position of the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and extends the reach of the hand (Fig. 7.3). The glenohumeral joint allows the arm to move around three axes with a wide range of motion. Movements of the arm at this joint are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial rotation (internal rotation), lateral rotation (external rotation), and circumduction (Fig. 7.4).", "answer": "Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial rotation, lateral rotation, and circumduction."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2062_2", "question": "How do the soft palate and parts of the larynx contribute to proper swallowing?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Normally, the soft palate, epiglottis, and soft tissue structures within the larynx act as valves to prevent food and liquid from entering lower parts of the respiratory tract (Fig. 8.16A). During normal breathing, the airway is open and air passes freely through the nasal cavities (or oral cavity), pharynx, larynx, and trachea (Fig. 8.16A). The lumen of the esophagus is normally closed because, unlike the airway, it has no skeletal support structures to hold it open. When the oral cavity is full of liquid or food, the soft palate is swung down (depressed) to close the oropharyngeal isthmus, thereby allowing manipulation of food and fluid in the oral cavity while breathing (Fig. 8.16C). When swallowing, the soft palate and parts of the larynx act as valves to ensure proper movement of food from the oral cavity into the esophagus (Fig. 8.16D).", "answer": "The soft palate and parts of the larynx contribute to proper swallowing by acting as valves that ensure the proper movement of food from the oral cavity into the esophagus, preventing food and liquid from entering the lower parts of the respiratory tract."}
