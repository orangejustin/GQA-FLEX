Allergic contact dermatitis represents the classic presentation of a T cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity response to exogenous agents. The initial step in the development of allergic contact dermatitis, as in nickel allergy, is hapten binding to a skin carrier protein. A hapten by itself is not immunogenic but becomes so after binding to a skin protein carrier. The hapten protein complex forms through covalent bonds between the hapten and amino acid side chains of target proteins within the skin. [8] The complex ultimately produces the sensitization of T cells. Sensitized T cells encountering the antigen at any time later will then lead to the release of cytokines, which in turn leads to macrophage activation and produces the immune response. [8] In summary, the sensitization process requires an initial exposure to allow the immune system to recognize the antigen later and lead to the immune response that causes ACD.", "answer": "Hapten binding to a skin carrier protein."}

The lower eyelid is supported medially by the medial canthal tendon and laterally by the lateral canthal tendon. At the tarsal plate level, the eyelid has a bi-lamellar structure with an anterior lamella of skin and orbicularis muscle with a suborbicularis fascial plane with minimal fat. The posterior lamella comprises the tarsus (which measures 1 mm in thickness and 5 to 6 mm in height) and conjunctiva. Below the level of the tarsal plate, the eyelid may be considered as having a tri-lamella structure with anterior lamella consisting of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle, the middle lamella comprising of the orbital septum, and to a degree, the lower eyelid retractors (called the capsulopalpebral fascia) with fat interposed between the septum and the retractors. At the orbital rim, the orbital septum fuses with the periosteum creating what is called the arcus marginalis.  The posterior lamella may be considered as consisting of, to a degree, the lower eyelid retractors and the conjunctiva. The lower eyelid retractors are analogous to the upper eyelid retractors (levator palpebrae superioris and its aponeurosis): the lower lid retractors arise from the inferior rectus muscle, envelope the inferior oblique muscle, and proceed to insert into the inferior border of the tarsal plate and orbital septum.  Like the levator palpebrae, the lower lid retractors are supplied by the oculomotor nerve. The equivalent of Muller's muscle (innervated by the sympathetic fibers originating from the carotid plexus) is a less defined muscle present just behind the capsulopalpebral fascia, often called the inferior tarsal smooth muscle. Similar to the Whitnall's ligament in the upper eyelid, Lockwood's ligament (the suspensory ligamentous sling supporting the globe) is attached laterally to the Whitnall's tubercle and inferolateral orbital rim and medially to the inferomedial orbital rim. Analogous to the upper eyelid post-levator aponeurosis fat pad, the lower eyelid has two additional thin layers of fat, the inter-lower eyelid retractor fat pad lying between the two layers of the lower eyelid retractors and the post-lower eyelid retractor fat pad lying between this and the conjunctiva. Whitnall’s tubercle is 3 to 4 mm inside the orbital rim and just above the horizontal axis.

Concurrent consumption of food (including dairy products) with oral quinolones has minimal effect on its absorption and activity. [20] [22] However, oral absorption of quinolones substantially decreases when taken together with other medications containing metallic cations due to the chelation that occurs between quinolone functional groups and the cations, leading to the formation of an insoluble compound. [23] [24] These can include multivitamin supplements containing iron or zinc and magnesium or aluminum-based antacids. The degree of absorption impairment depends on the individual quinolone, but generally, the recommendation is to stagger medications to avoid these interactions, with many studies suggesting that quinolones be taken either 1 to 2 hours before or 3 to 4 hours after the administration of metallic cation compounds.

A complete blood count may reveal low hemoglobin, leukocytosis, and moderately elevated ESR. Chest X-ray may reveal fibrotic changes, cavitation, or old scar of pulmonary tuberculosis; an abdominal roentgenogram may reveal prominent large bowel. Abdominal and pelvis CT scans may show diffuse thickening of the colonic wall, especially of the terminal ileum and the cecum. A colonoscopy usually shows diffuse ulceration throughout the colon, from the rectum to cecum. Histopathological biopsies taken from the cecum show caseating granuloma and chronic inflammatory cells. Mantoux skin test (tuberculin test) is usually requested. This test does not measure immunity to tuberculosis but the degree of hypersensitivity to tuberculin. The results must be interpreted carefully with consideration to the patient's medical risk factors. Usually, the Mantoux test becomes negative in these patients after being previously positive, indicating the fading of resistance to the organism.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1245_0", "question": "What is the venous drainage of the testis?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele. The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

{"id": "article-29092_2_1", "question": "What does the SPF number represent in sunscreen?", "doc_chunk": "Skin Cancer Prevention -- Function. Other than avoiding the sun at peak hours and wearing protective clothing, using sunscreen is the single-best habit patients can develop to reduce their risk of skin cancer. Sunscreens come in various types and contain different ingredients that protect against the sun in different ways. Chemical ingredients, such as the frequently used para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and cinnamates, absorb solar rays and change UV rays into heat energy. Ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide work as a physical barrier that deflects UV rays off of the skin. Selecting sunscreens that are labeled as broad-spectrum is important because that indicates that the patient will be protected from both UVA and UVB rays. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, aside from creating great barrier protection, are excellent ingredients to look for in sunscreens due to their broad-spectrum UV coverage. [9] An important topic when counseling patients about skin cancer prevention is the sun protection factor (SPF). The SPF number represents the amount of protection from sunburn that sunscreen offers compared to using no sunscreen at all. For example, if a patient’s skin would normally take 10 minutes to burn and the patient appropriately applies SPF 30 sunscreen, it would take him or her 30 times longer (300 minutes) to burn. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a sunscreen with SPF 30, which filters out about 97% of UV rays from the sun.

Anatomical knowledge of this region of the chest explains why the wire broke. Many patients have cardiac pacemakers. A wire arises from the pacemaker, which lies within the subcutaneous tissue over the pectoralis major muscle and travels from the pacemaker under the skin to pierce the axillary vein just beneath the clavicle, lateral to the subclavius muscle. The wire then passes through the subclavian vein, the brachiocephalic vein, the superior vena cava, and the right atrium, and lies on the wall of the right ventricle (where it can stimulate the heart to contract) (eFig. 3.118). If the wire pierces the axillary vein directly adjacent to the subclavius muscle, it is possible that after many years of shoulder movement the subclavius muscle stresses and breaks the wire, causing the pacemaker to fail.

{"id": "article-29092_2_0", "question": "How does zinc oxide protect the skin against UV rays in sunscreen?", "doc_chunk": "Skin Cancer Prevention -- Function. Other than avoiding the sun at peak hours and wearing protective clothing, using sunscreen is the single-best habit patients can develop to reduce their risk of skin cancer. Sunscreens come in various types and contain different ingredients that protect against the sun in different ways. Chemical ingredients, such as the frequently used para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and cinnamates, absorb solar rays and change UV rays into heat energy. Ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide work as a physical barrier that deflects UV rays off of the skin. Selecting sunscreens that are labeled as broad-spectrum is important because that indicates that the patient will be protected from both UVA and UVB rays. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, aside from creating great barrier protection, are excellent ingredients to look for in sunscreens due to their broad-spectrum UV coverage. [9] An important topic when counseling patients about skin cancer prevention is the sun protection factor (SPF). The SPF number represents the amount of protection from sunburn that sunscreen offers compared to using no sunscreen at all. For example, if a patient’s skin would normally take 10 minutes to burn and the patient appropriately applies SPF 30 sunscreen, it would take him or her 30 times longer (300 minutes) to burn. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a sunscreen with SPF 30, which filters out about 97% of UV rays from the sun.

Lymphatic capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels that originate blindly within the extracellular space of various tissues. Lymphatic capillaries tend to be larger in diameter than blood capillaries and are interspersed among them to enhance their ability to collect interstitial fluid efficiently. They are critical in the drainage of extracellular fluid and allow this fluid to enter the closed capillaries but not exit due to their unique morphology. Lymphatic capillaries at their blind ends are composed of a thin endothelium without a basement membrane. The endothelial cells at the closed end of the capillary overlap but shift to open the capillary end when interstitial fluid pressure is greater than intra-capillary pressure. This process permits lymphocytes, interstitial fluid, bacteria, cellular debris, plasma proteins, and other cells to enter the lymphatic capillaries. Special lymphatic capillaries called lacteals exist in the small intestine to contribute to the absorption of dietary fats.

Asphyxiation may occur secondary to immobility of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, as the patient will be unable to abduct the vocal cords, preventing them from opening the rima glottidis. [11] This type of injury is possible during thyroidectomy surgery, in which the recurrent laryngeal nerves are susceptible to damage bilaterally, stymying the motor innervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles resulting in neurogenic vocal cord paralysis. [12] Thyroidectomy exposes the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to injury, potentially resulting in cricothyroid muscle paralysis and subsequent voice disorders. [15] Intraoperative neuromonitoring may be an effective strategy to alleviate the risk of injury to neurovascular structures during thyroidectomy surgery.

There has been great improvement in increasing access to various forms of LARC in recent years. However, some barriers remain, especially for nulliparous women and adolescents. There are groups of healthcare providers that have not been fully educated on the use of LARC in nulliparous patients, including adolescents. There is evidence to suggest that these methods should be encouraged in these populations because of their reversibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the barriers that remain for adolescents and nulliparous women include unfamiliarity and/or discomfort with the device, initial cost of device and insertion, lack of parental acceptance, and unfamiliarity of the healthcare provider providing the consultation. However, research has shown that when patients are educated at length on the various forms of contraception available with no worry of cost, 67% of women chose a form of LARC, with 56% choosing an IUD. [19] [Level 3] Therefore, as healthcare providers, it is imperative to stay up-to-date on guidelines for improving access to critical healthcare for patients. For example, there had been studies that showed nulliparous women should not be started on IUDs because of an inherent risk of pelvic inflammatory disorder, leading to future infertility. However, these reports have since been refuted and show that these devices are safe for nulliparous women to use.

Respiration is a vital process for the normal function at every level of organization from a cell to an organism; oxygen, supplied by local circulation at the tissue level, functions at the mitochondrial internal membrane as an essential mediator for the energy release. In mitochondria, digested nutrients undergo metabolic reactions, end up at the level of the electron transport chain, and release high-energy compounds (ATP). The main byproduct of this process, carbon dioxide, gets released in the venous blood returning to the lungs. Carbon dioxide diffuses through alveolar walls and dissolves in the exhaled amount of air. The respiratory rate, i.e., the number of breaths per minute, is highly regulated to enable cells to produce the optimum amount of energy at any given occasion. A complex nervous system of nerve tissues regulates the rate of oxygen inflow and carbon dioxide outflow. It adjusts it accordingly in conditions that tend to derange partial gas pressures in blood.

The spinal needle is then advanced in millimeter increments with continuous gentle pressure on the plunger of the LOR syringe. When the ligamentum flavum has penetrated a loss of resistance is felt through the plunger, and the normal saline is injected due to negative pressure upon penetration into epidural space. Firm, careful control of needle depth is vital as syringes are exchanged at this stage to avoid the advancement of the needle. The LOR syringe is exchanged for a syringe containing iodinated contrast, and a small amount is injected to ensure epidural placement. [10] On AP view, an asymmetric, vacuolated contrast spread consistent with epidural placement view should be observed. If the placement is too dorsal due to a false loss of resistance, a dense blotch may is observable suggesting the needle needs to be advanced further using the LOR technique once again. Or, a rapidly dissipating vascular pattern implies arterial injection, and the placement should be adjusted. If the needle has been advanced too far ventrally, a symmetrical, smooth, and faint pattern may be observed suggesting subdural injection. In this case, the clinician should withdraw the needle and an alternative interlaminar site selected.

PD is performed in a procedural suite with x-ray fluoroscopy.  The patient is positioned prone (except in the case of cervical discography where they are supine). A chlorohexidine-based prep and occlusive drapes should be utilized. Intravenous antibiotics should be administered before skin puncture, or intradiscal antibiotics may be used, or both. The performing physician should perform a surgical scrub and don a sterile gown and double gloves, and not touch the distal portion of the needle that will be entering the disc. Only light sedation, if any, is preferred. This procedure can be performed under local anesthetic or by the additional administration of oral valium to help ensure that the patient is relatively comfortable but not heavily sedated since real-time accurate patient feedback is essential. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the nucleus pulposus of each disc to be tested is entered with the smallest gauge needle possible, typically a 22 or 25 gauge spinal needle. The discs are then sequentially pressurized with contrast, and the patient’s response to pressurization of each disc is noted. If pain reproduced is of adequate severity and similar in quality to the patient’s usual spine pain, the test is deemed concordant; however, if the pain produced is dissimilar to the patient's usual spine pain, the test is discordant. PD results are valid if all of the following criteria are satisfied: the patient is alert enough to relate information reliably, manometry is utilized for each disc tested, and a radiographically normal control disc does not produce concordant pain when pressurized. Some authors have advocated adding local anesthetic after the provocation portion to improve diagnostic accuracy, but the literature is conflicting. At the conclusion of the test, the patient may be sent for a post-procedure non-contrast CT scan which allows the evaluating physician to better appreciate disc morphology as compared to fluoroscopy alone.", "answer": "CT scan."}
{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_769_1", "question": "What do the anterior and posterior branches of the renal artery supply?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2025_2", "question": "Where is the typical site for compression of the suprascapular nerve?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles are supplied by the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6), which originates from the superior trunk of the brachial plexus. Given that only these muscles were involved, it is highly likely that the muscle atrophy is caused by denervation. Denervation may result from a direct nerve transection, nerve compression, or a pharmacological effect on the nerve. The typical site for compression of the suprascapular nerve is the suprascapular notch (foramen) on the superior margin of the scapula. The patient’s apparently minor injury damaged the fibrocartilaginous glenoid labrum, which allowed a cyst to form and pass along the superior border of the scapula to the suprascapular notch (foramen), where the cyst compressed the suprascapular nerve.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2210_1", "question": "What is the role of the palpebral part of the orbicularis oculi muscle?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The upper and lower eyelids are basically similar in structure except for the addition of two muscles in the upper eyelid. The skin of the eyelids is not particularly substantial, and only a thin layer of connective tissue separates the skin from the underlying voluntary muscle layer (Fig. 8.77). The thin layer of connective tissue and its loose arrangement account for the accumulation of fluid (blood) when an injury occurs. The muscle fibers encountered next in an anteroposterior direction through the eyelid belong to the palpebral part of the orbicularis oculi (Fig. 8.77). This muscle is part of the larger orbicularis oculi muscle, which consists primarily of two parts—an orbital part, which surrounds the orbit, and the palpebral part, which is in the eyelids. The orbicularis oculi is innervated by the facial nerve [VII] and closes the eyelids.", "answer": "The role of the palpebral part of the orbicularis oculi muscle is to close the eyelids."}

The surgical and endovascular treatment options were explained to the patient. Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been, for many years, an operative procedure where the dilation (ballooning) of the aorta is resected and a graft is sewn into position. A modern option is to place a graft to line the aneurysm from within the artery (endovascular aneurysm repair). In this technique the surgeon dissects the femoral artery and makes a small hole in it. The graft is compressed within a catheter and the catheter is passed through the femoral artery and the iliac arterial system into the distal abdominal aorta.

The fact that other treatment modalities for depression target dopamine, norepinephrine, and catecholamine transmission implies that the serotonergic system is one of the multiple components in the pathogenesis of depression. For example, in patients who respond well to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, the depletion of catecholamines rather than serotonin is more closely linked to symptomatology. Furthermore, some patients experience improvement of symptoms when SSRI therapy is augmented with a second agent such as a dopamine agonist, highlighting a multifactorial etiology. Current research explores novel targets to alleviate MDD symptoms and to do so more rapidly. [10] Also, the investigation into the microbiota-gut-brain axis holds promise for future treatment modalities. While the raphe nuclei synthesize the majority of serotonin in the central nervous system, most of the serotonin in the entire body gets synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract.

The mammillary region or mammillary body is the final group of nuclei in the medial zone. Four nuclei comprise this region: medial, intermediate, lateral mammillary, and posterior hypothalamic. The best defined is the medial mammillary nucleus, as it is the primary site for the termination of axons from the postcommissural fornix. This pathway originates from the subiculum of the hippocampal complex and plays a key role in memory. The medial mammillary nuclei also connects to structures of the limbic system. The periventricular zone resides medial to the medial zone and adjacent to the ependymal cells of the third ventricle. Neurons from this zone predominantly synthesize releasing hormones. Axons from these neuronal cells project through the tuberoinfundibular tract to the hypophysial portal system to influence release of hormones from the anterior pituitary.", "answer": "The tuberoinfundibular tract projects axons from neurons in the periventricular zone to the hypophysial portal system, influencing the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1092_0", "question": "What is the main function of the sympathetic trunks in the pelvis?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The paravertebral part of the visceral nervous system is represented in the pelvis by the inferior ends of the sympathetic trunks (Fig. 5.63A). Each trunk enters the pelvic cavity from the abdomen by passing over the ala of the sacrum medially to the lumbosacral trunks and posteriorly to the iliac vessels. The trunks course inferiorly along the anterior surface of the sacrum, where they are positioned medially to the anterior sacral foramina. Four ganglia occur along each trunk. Anteriorly to the coccyx, the two trunks join to form a single small terminal ganglion (the ganglion impar). The principal function of the sympathetic trunks in the pelvis is to deliver postganglionic sympathetic fibers to the anterior rami of sacral nerves for distribution to the periphery, mainly to parts of the lower limb and perineum. This is accomplished by gray rami communicantes, which connect the trunks to the sacral anterior rami.", "answer": "The main function of the sympathetic trunks in the pelvis is to deliver postganglionic sympathetic fibers to the anterior rami of sacral nerves for distribution to the periphery, mainly to parts of the lower limb and perineum."}

A course of antibiotics was given to remove the bacteria that had produced the inflammation. On return to the doctor some days later the gland was normal in size and there was no evidence of inflammation or infection. An operation was necessary. The stone was at the distal end of the parotid duct and it would seem logical and straightforward to make a small incision at the sphincter in the buccal mucosa and deliver the stone, thus permitting the gland to drain normally. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case the gland was significantly destroyed by the chronic obstruction and bacterial infection. Furthermore, smaller calculi were also demonstrated in the gland at ultrasound. On direct questioning it appeared that the patient had had numerous attacks over the previous 4–5 years and it was decided that the parotid gland should be removed surgically.", "answer": "To remove the bacteria causing inflammation and infection."}

It is the author’s preference to use the Doppler as an adjunct to the Allen test as well, especially if refill to the palm is sluggish. This test is ideally performed with two people. The assistant uses the Doppler on the palm of the hand to confirm a distal extremity pulse. The ulnar and radial arteries are then compressed by the surgeon, and the Doppler should go silent due to a lack of arterial inflow. The ulnar artery is then released, and the Doppler signal should resume with the pulse. If there is no return of pulse, the radial artery should be tested by confirming a pulse on the hand with the ulnar artery compressed. If the Doppler detects a pulse on the distal extremity with the ulnar artery compressed, the hand is supplied by the radial artery predominantly, and radial forearm flap harvest should be aborted in favor of another reconstructive option. One disadvantage of this method is that it cannot detect the rare instance of an incomplete superficial palmar arch. The Doppler should be used in conjunction with the Allen test to confirm the signs of capillary refill to the entire hand from the ulnar artery alone. If there is concern about the ability of the distal extremity to rely solely on the ulnar artery, the flap should be aborted in favor of a different reconstructive option.", "answer": "The Doppler is used alongside the Allen test to ensure the ulnar artery alone can adequately supply blood to the hand if the radial artery is used for the flap, by monitoring the return of the pulse in the palm after arterial compressions."}

{"id": "article-29723_10_0", "question": "How does superoxide play a role in cell survival and cell signaling pathways?", "doc_chunk": "Biochemistry, Superoxides -- Function. Large amounts of superoxide are produced as the body generates inflammatory NO, leading to increased peroxynitrite concentrations, a cytotoxic mediator molecule. [20] When considerable amounts accumulate in the cells, these play an essential role in cell survival, specifically involving activation or inactivation of G proteins JAK or STAT proteins, NK-kappa B, and MAPK pathways. [20] The formation of hydroxyl radicals can lead to direct DNA damage after oxidative stress. [22] Research has also shown that superoxide can modulate vascular tone, cell growth, gene expression, and signaling in blood vessels. [11] As previously mentioned, superoxide is readily converted to hydrogen peroxide by SODs. Hydrogen peroxide then can undergo reduction to water by the action of glutathione peroxidase or catalase, ridding the cell of possibly dangerous radicals. [22] Glutathione peroxidase converts hydrogen peroxide to water, whereas catalase converts hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_138_1", "question": "Where do rib elements develop in regions other than the thorax?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. A spinous process projects posteriorly and generally inferiorly from the roof of the vertebral arch. On each side of the vertebral arch, a transverse process extends laterally from the region where a lamina meets a pedicle. From the same region, a superior articular process and an inferior articular process articulate with similar processes on adjacent vertebrae. Each vertebra also contains rib elements. In the thorax, these costal elements are large and form ribs, which articulate with the vertebral bodies and transverse processes. In all other regions, these rib elements are small and are incorporated into the transverse processes. Occasionally, they develop into ribs in regions other than the thorax, usually in the lower cervical and upper lumbar regions. Muscles in the back can be classified as extrinsic or intrinsic based on their embryological origin and type of innervation (Fig. 2.7).", "answer": "Lower cervical and upper lumbar regions."}

Fatty acids and proteins stimulate the release of CCK via a direct action on the I-cells. GPR40 is a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on I-cells that responds to long-chain fatty acids. Discharge of vagal efferent neurons is stimulated by the action of CCK on CCK-1 receptors and increase intracellular calcium. They find these neurons in both the stomach and small intestines, and CCK initially activates the afferent fibers in the small intestine via a paracrine mechanism. This inhibits the excitatory vagal efferent pathway to the distal stomach. Gastric vagal afferents are stimulated in response to the hormonal effect coupled with the inhibitory vagal efferent pathway to the proximal stomach. [9] Due to the mechanism mentioned above, CCK can inhibit gastric emptying by relaxing the proximal portion of the stomach, which increases tension in the pyloric sphincter. At high levels of CCK can increase the effect of how fast gastric emptying occurs, and it does this by increasing the excitatory effect it has on both the small and large intestine, which leads to movement in the bowels or by improving the tension of the pyloric sphincter. [5] Therefore, the reflex control of gastric emptying is regulated by CCK action on vasovagal reflexes and the hormonal activation of a variety of pathways that are coupled to vagal efferent pathways controlling gastric motility.", "answer": "CCK inhibits gastric emptying by activating afferent fibers in the small intestine, which inhibits the excitatory vagal efferent pathway to the distal stomach, and by stimulating gastric vagal afferents, leading to relaxation of the proximal stomach and increased tension in the pyloric sphincter."}

{"id": "article-30469_4_1", "question": "What arteries are crucial for the blood supply when using the gastric tube as a conduit in transhiatal esophagectomy?", "doc_chunk": "Transhiatal Esophagectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology. The transesophageal esophagectomy requires an excellent understanding of both gastric and colonic blood supplies as well and thoracic and cervical anatomy. Since the majority of the thoracic dissection is done bluntly and without direct visualization, a surgeon's touch, feel, and knowledge of anatomy is paramount for a successful case. Preoperative planning requires a decision of the conduit that will be presumed as the primary choice. The primary choice for the transhiatal esophagectomy is the gastric tube created on the greater curvature of the stomach. This tube is brought to the neck for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. The tube's blood supply is through the right gastroepiploic artery, and this needs to be preserved as the rest of the blood supply to the stomach is divided. This provides adequate length for the tube to reach into the neck. In the area of the left gastric artery arises an aberrant left hepatic artery at times, which needs to be sought if present and preserved. On occasion, the gastric tube cannot be used, and the left colon is used as the conduit in an isoperistaltic fashion. The blood supply to the left colon is maintained with the left colic artery, and the middle colic is divided. An antiperistaltic left colon can be used as well based on the middle colic artery but is less preferred. The blood supply to the colon conduit necessitates a patent marginal artery of Drummond and should be assessed prior to isolating the entire colon length.", "answer": "Right gastroepiploic artery."}

Acrokeratoelastoidosis (AKE) of Oswaldo Costa, or inverse papular acrokeratosis , is a rare autosomal-dominant genodermatosis first described in 1952 by Oswaldo Costa, a Brazilian dermatologist. [1] It characteristically presents with flesh-colored papules on the lateral areas of the palms, soles, and dorsum of hands. Acrokeratoelastoidosis is a type of marginal keratoderma that principally affects the lateral portion of the palmoplantar regions [Figures 1 (A) and (B)] . Apart from inherited cases, there are reports of sporadic occurrences of this condition.

Quinolones are most often administered through oral and intravenous (IV) routes, though topical formulations in the form of ophthalmic solutions also exist. Oral quinolones are rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and possess a high oral bioavailability, allowing the oral and IV routes of administration to be used interchangeably for certain quinolones. [13] [14] Though quinolones are widely distributed throughout the body, the degree of penetration into tissues and bodily fluids depends on the individual quinolone. For example, while levofloxacin penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is relatively poor, moxifloxacin has been noted to have good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid, allowing it to be used effectively for tuberculosis meningitis. [15] Most quinolones are predominantly eliminated unchanged by the kidney via glomerular filtration and some degree of tubular secretion. [16] [17] They are typically eliminated through the hepatic and trans-intestinal routes to a lesser extent, though the degree to which they undergo elimination through these routes depends on the individual quinolones.

How the osteotomies are performed depends upon the surgeon's preference. It is the author's preference to perform right-angle cuts to remove a rectangular block of bone through the distal and proximal limits of the osteotomies, as opposed to a “canoe boat” or “keel-boat” which is often described. When exposing the bone for osteotomy, care is taken to preserve the periosteum over the bone. The length of the bone to be harvested is delineated. The limits of the bone harvest are the head of the radius distally and the insertion of the pronator teres muscle proximally. Roughly 50% of the height of the radius is identified by visual inspection and palpation with the arm pronated and supinated. A scalpel can be used to incise the periosteum and mark the planned osteotomies. Osteotomies can then be made with the saw along the incised periosteum. Care should be taken during the completion of the vertical osteotomies to avoid pass-cutting into the residual radius.  Doing so can weaken the bone that remains after graft harvest.

A true shunt in acute asthma averages only 1.5% of pulmonary blood flow. Therefore, oxygen supplementation needed in status asthmaticus is an infrequent and low dose. Refractory hypoxemia in status asthmaticus should trigger a search for complications like pneumonia, atelectasis, or barotrauma. Heliox is a mixture of 70:30 or 60:40 helium: oxygen decreases airway resistance and turbulence and reduces work of breathing and inspiratory muscle fatigue.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2977_0", "question": "What is the anteriormost structure of the eye that allows light to enter?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Although the retinal layer of the eyeball is often considered the beginning of visual perception, the anterior structures of the eye play an important role in visual perception too. The anteriormost structure is the cornea and is the first layer through which light, the visual stimulus, enters the eye (eFig. 9.72). This transparent layer overlies the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber and the pupil, a small central aperture that controls how much light is admitted into the eye. After passing through the pupil light is refracted through the lens, which along with the ciliary body, separates the anterior portion of the eye from the posterior portion (eFig. 9.72). The lens is a clear biconvex structure that rounds in shape as the ciliary muscle contracts and relaxes the suspensory ligaments attached to the borders of the lens, a parasympathetically controlled process referred to as accommodation.", "answer": "cornea"}

Although the mechanism by which HLAB-27 causes disease is unknown, several hypotheses have been postulated. According to the arthritogenic peptide hypothesis, when HLA-B27 forms a bond with a peptide from a microbial source, it triggers a CD8 T cell response to a self-peptide with a similar structure to the microbial peptide . Evidence for this mechanism has surfaced in patients who develop reactive arthritis after salmonella or chlamydia infections, which trigger a specific HLA-B27 CD8 T cell response. The misfolding hypothesis suggests that HLA-B27 may misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing functional alterations in dendritic cell populations and function, increased formation of osteoclasts, and also increased IL-23 production, which has been shown to have pathogenic effect in spondyloarthropathy.

The primary treatment of uncomplicated nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a regimen of nasolacrimal massage, usually 2  to 3 times per day, accompanied by a cleansing of the lids with warm water and topical antibiotics; this will resolve the infection in 76% to 89% of cases. [6] [7] [8] Topical antibiotics are used for control of mucopurulent drainage, and a bland ophthalmic ointment may be used on the eyelids if the skin is macerated. In cases that do not resolve by age 6 to 10 months, lacrimal duct probing is performed by pediatric ophthalmology in the office (Bowman probe) or in the operating room (intranasal cysts or infection), depending on the age of the child. [9] During the procedure the physician inserts a probe or irrigation cannula and advances it through the lacrimal drainage system until it touches the obstruction; the probe is then pushed through the obstruction into the nose. Irrigation with fluorescein-stained saline is often achieved to warrant patency. If concomitant infection or cellulitis is present, systemic antibiotics should be used first, then probing is done.

OM3FAs are also believed to reduce high triglycerides by influencing total body lipid accretion. Several studies have found that prolonged use of OM3FAs for more than six weeks can increase the body's metabolic rate and decrease total body fat. [43] [35] [44] More specifically, study participants showed an increase in lean muscle mass, decreased fat mass, an increase in resting metabolic rate, increased energy expenditure during exercise, and increased fat oxidation both during rest and exercise. [43] [35] [45] [44] On a cellular level, this is caused by OM3FAs ability to act as a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), whose transcription factor activity can change gene expression involved in energy homeostasis. [43] [46] PPARs regulate both fatty acid metabolism (beta-oxidation) and glucose metabolism and can change the basal metabolism of the cell.

The ulnar nerve carries both sensory and motor fibers from the C8 and T1 dorsal rami. The nerve courses along the medial arm from the anterior to the posterior compartment, through the medial intermuscular septum, called the arcade of Struthers. The arcade is formed by the medial head of the biceps, medial intermuscular septum, and internal brachial ligament. It then passes posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus, giving off its first branch providing proprioception to the elbow joint. At the distal elbow, the ulnar nerve passes underneath Osbourne's ligament (retinaculum between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle). It continues through the flexor and pronator muscles of the forearm and into the wrist, superficial to the flexor retinaculum. The ulnar nerve enters the hand through Guyon's canal, a fibro-osseous tunnel formed by the pisiform and hook of the hamate.

A thorough evaluation of ocular injuries is critical in identifying injuries in an attempt to preserve vision. [1] [2] One test that helps evaluate ocular trauma is the Seidel test. The Seidel test assesses for the presence of aqueous humor leakage from the anterior chamber. This leakage is from a defect in the cornea or sclera from multiple causes, including trauma, post-surgical leak, corneal perforation, and corneal degeneration. The test was first described in 1921 by Dr. Erich Seidel (1882-1948), a German ophthalmologist, for which the test is named. He used the test to evaluate leakage in the postoperative patient but later expanded its use to other causes or anterior chamber leakage.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_1641_2", "question": "Why is an appreciation of ankle anatomy essential in the clinic?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. One of the problems with fractures of the talus is that the blood supply to the bone is vulnerable to damage. The main blood supply to the bone enters the talus through the tarsal sinus from a branch of the posterior tibial artery. This vessel supplies most of the neck and the body of the talus. Branches of the dorsalis pedis artery enter the superior aspect of the talar neck and supply the dorsal portion of the head and neck, and branches from the fibular artery supply a small portion of the lateral talus. Fractures of the neck of the talus often interrupt the blood supply to the talus, so making the body and posterior aspect of the talus susceptible to osteonecrosis, which may in turn lead to premature osteoarthritis and require extensive surgery.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2846_2", "question": "What might cause a deviation of the nasal septum?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The larynx is typically visualized using two methods. Indirect laryngoscopy involves passage of a small rod-mounted mirror (not dissimilar to a dental mirror) into the oropharynx permitting indirect visualization of the larynx. Direct laryngoscopy can be performed using a device with a curved metal tip that holds the tongue and epiglottis forward, allowing direct inspection of the larynx. This procedure can be performed only in the unconscious patient or in a patient in whom the gag reflex is not intact. Other methods of inspection include the passage of fiberoptic endoscopes through either the oral cavity or nasal cavity. In the clinic The nasal septum is typically situated in the midline; however, septal deviation to one side or the other is not uncommon, and in many cases is secondary to direct trauma. Extreme septal deviation can produce nasal occlusion. The deviation can be corrected surgically. In the clinic", "answer": "Direct trauma."}

Quinolones act by impairing DNA synthesis through the inhibition of bacterial type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV). In pregnant women, there are theoretical concerns that the quinolones could potentially inhibit DNA synthesis in the growing fetus, leading to fetal organ agenesis, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. [11] Though animal models have demonstrated possible teratogenic effects of quinolones, research has not yet found an association between quinolone use in the first trimester and major fetal malformations. Also, quinolone use in the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with risk for preterm delivery or stillbirth. However, one case-control study did demonstrate an associated increased risk of spontaneous abortion with quinolone use. In light of these potential risks, quinolone use requires caution in pregnant women and not as a first-line agent, especially for those still in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Methemoglobin forms when hemoglobin is oxidized to contain iron in the ferric [Fe3+] rather than the normal ferrous [Fe2+] state. Any of the four iron species within a hemoglobin molecule that are in the ferric form are unable to bind oxygen. The presence of iron in the ferric [Fe3+] state results in allosteric changes to the molecule that shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left. This shift leads to increased affinity of the ferrous iron for oxygen and thus impaired oxygen release to the tissue.

Someone can use craniotomy or simple burr holes for drainage. If it involves the dura, graft or other occlusive approaches might be helpful. After clinicians get samples and cultures, they should start antibiotics as soon as possible. Since this is a relatively rare disease, information available for antibiotic choice is mostly anecdotal. They should choose antibiotics for Streptococcus , Hemophilus , and anaerobes to cover infections that have spread from the ear, sinuses, or other areas of the head and neck. Third-generation cephalosporins plus vancomycin plus metronidazole is one regimen. They can then change treatment based on cultures and sensitivities. [15] Vancomycin does not cross the blood-brain barrier; therefore, some authors advocate using Rifampin in its place while others may consider a short course of steroids. Linezolid and daptomycin have also been used, but data on their efficacy is very limited. Antibiotic therapy is usually 6 to 8 weeks of intravenous agents since oral agents will probably not achieve a therapeutic level in CSF that is needed for a cure.

Based on the origin of the anorectal fistula development from cryptoglandular abscesses, the internal opening of most fistulas is located at the dentate line. The type of fistula is most commonly diagnosed at an anorectal examination under anesthesia, where anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy can be performed at the time of fistula tract exploration. The decision of which structures the fistula connection incorporates, i.e., internal and external sphincter complex is important as only a small amount of external sphincter muscle that can be cut. [7] Up to 30% of the external sphincter muscle can be cut without compromising fecal continence. To avoid the cutting of too much external sphincter and to decrease the risk of fecal incontinence as well as to allow adequate drainage following abscess drainage, a Seton can be placed through the tract. Seton can either be utilized to slowly cut through the sphincter muscle over time, called 'cutting Seton.' Setons can also be placed into fistula tracks to allow previously undrained collections to heal around the seton slowly, called a 'non-cutting Seton.' In addition to the depth of the fistula, there are certain clues as to where the fistula tract originates from the location of the external opening. This is from Goodsall's rule, which states that if a transverse line is drawn across the anus, a fistulous external opening which is anterior to this line and will be located internally 3 cm of the anal verge, with the fistulas tract radially and directly into the anal canal. However, if the external opening is posterior to this line or outside of the 3 to 4 cm area from the anal verge, then these fistulas tend to arc around to the posterior midline anal gland. These arching fistula tracts are sometimes difficult to completely discern at the first operation, so the tract can be partially unroofed towards to anal verge being careful to avoid the destruction of the external anal sphincter. Although Goodsall's rule has been taught for years, there are some challenges to this rule recently; however, for simple fistulas, it is a good starting point.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_970_0", "question": "What was the cause of the elevation of the right hemidiaphragm in the chest radiograph?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. A chest radiograph demonstrated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. This elevation of the right hemidiaphragm was due to the pus tracking from the hepatorenal space around the lateral and anterior aspect of the liver to sit on top of the liver in a subphrenic position. An ultrasound scan demonstrated this collection of fluid. The abscess cavity could be clearly seen by placing the ultrasound probe between ribs XI and XII. The inferior border of the right lower lobe lies at rib X in the midaxillary line. When the probe is placed between ribs XI and XII the ultrasound waves pass between the intercostal muscles and the parietal pleura laterally on the chest wall, and continue through the parietal pleura overlying the diaphragm into the cavity of the abscess, which lies below the diaphragm.", "answer": "The cause of the elevation of the right hemidiaphragm in the chest radiograph was due to pus tracking from the hepatorenal space to sit on top of the liver in a subphrenic position."}

There are several pitfalls in the evaluation of trauma patients that should be avoided if at all possible. If a patient has a clinical deterioration during the trauma evaluation, do not continue with the next step in the evaluation. Immediately go back to the ABCDE evaluation of the patient as this is most likely to identify a life-threatening condition. Similarly, do not be distracted by obvious injuries such as burns, open extremity fractures, or penetrating injuries and, therefore, not follow the sequence of ABCDE evaluation. Another pitfall to avoid is not to send the hemodynamically unstable patient away from the resuscitation area to obtain testing, such as X-rays or CT scans. Further, do not delay transfer to definitive care, if not at the highest level of care, to obtain tests or perform unnecessary procedures. Once the identification of the need to transfer to a higher level of care is identified, the transfer process should be initiated.", "answer": "It is important to avoid delays in transferring a trauma patient to definitive care to ensure that they receive the highest level of care as quickly as possible, without unnecessary delays caused by tests or procedures that could be handled at the higher-level facility."}

Duodenal atresia is a relatively common intestinal disorder that often presents soon after delivery; hence it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatric surgeon, obstetrician, neonatal nurse, dietitian, pediatrician, intensivist, and geneticist. The definitive management of this condition is surgery, but the procedure is often associated with complications that prolong hospital stay. Over the past three decades, the mortality rates of duodenal atresia have significantly dropped, averaging 2% to 5%. Mortality rates are not directly related to the surgery but to the other associated organ anomalies like complex congenital cardiac defects. However, survival continues to improve with better NICU care, nutritional support, and improved pediatric anesthesia. Today long-term survival of most infants (more than 80%) with duodenal atresia is the norm.

Many patients with Meckel diverticulum are asymptomatic. Risk factors for increased risk of developing symptoms include age younger than 50, male gender, diverticulum greater than 2 cm in length, the presence of ectopic tissue, broad-based diverticulum, and fibrous bands attached to the diverticulum. [2] The pancreatic bicarbonate in the duodenum typically neutralizes the acid secreted by the normal gastric mucosa. In a Meckel diverticulum, the ectopic gastric mucosa secretes an acid that is not neutralized resulting in ulceration of the adjacent mucosa leading to painless rectal bleeding. The ectopic mucosa can also originate from the pancreas, jejunum, or a combination of the mucosa. [6] The site of the bleeding is usually distal to the diverticulum and not within the diverticulum. The presence of a fibrous band attached to the diverticulum can result in small bowel obstruction. The diverticulum can also act as a lead point for an intussusception leading to small bowel obstruction. [7] The incarceration of the Meckel diverticulum can also result in small bowel obstruction.

{"id": "article-29808_16_1", "question": "What areas of the body can be potential donor sites for full-thickness skin grafts in syndactyly surgical treatment?", "doc_chunk": "Syndactyly -- Treatment / Management -- Surgical Release. The zig-zag approach to the commissure allows for triangular based flaps to be created to assist with coverage of the digits. Planning the incision should start distally at the fingertips where planning for the paronychial fold begins. The typical technique for the development of these folds involves laterally based triangular flaps that, once released, will be sutured into the respective digit creating a new nail fold. [12] Next, the dorsal and palmar incisions are drawn proximally in a zig-zag fashion to create the previously described triangular flaps. It is important to ensure the flaps are drawn in such a way that the dorsal and volar flaps will not interdigitate with each other. [8] As the incision is planned distally, the planned height of the webspace is determined. Once determined, a dorsal rectangular flap is typically drawn with a volar triangular based flap. Once the incisions are drawn, the case starts distally, starting with the paronychial folds and progresses about the dorsal incision. It is important to create full-thickness flaps as you proceed with your dissection. Careful dissection is carried out to identify the neurovascular bundles. Typically, these bifurcate proximally, but cases have been noted with a more distal bifurcation. If a distal bifurcation is noted, it is important to carefully dissect each neurovascular bundle so they can be incorporated into the correct digit. Once the dorsal dissection is completed, attention can be turned volar, and the separation can be completed. Next, tension-free closure is performed. If any areas of skin cannot be closed adequately with tension-free closure, full-thickness skin grafts from the hypothenar eminence, instep of the foot, wrist, cubital fossa, or groin can be obtained to fill the defects. [2] [3] [4] [5] [8] [13] When selecting a skin graft, it is important to take from an area that has a lack of hair growth, as this could lead to an undesirable cosmetic result.  It is important to avoid split-thickness grafts as these are known to contract up to 50% and will achieve an undesirable post-operative result.

The presence of these molecules in higher than normal concentrations drives towards the formation of the atherosclerotic plaques and to defects in the endothelial relaxation, thus promoting the progress from asymptomatic disease to a broad clinical picture. [30] Superoxide has implications in the pathogenesis of hypertension due to evidence that increasing the concentrations of SODs in the vasculature improves hypertension, oxidation markers, kidney damage, glomerular filtration, and vessel relaxation. [11] The extent of atherosclerosis correlates positively with higher superoxide production, and NADPH oxidase-mediated production was highest in macrophage-rich areas of the atherosclerotic plaque.

The penis is a male organ that is used for reproduction and urination which is located within the urogenital triangle between the perineal membrane superiorly and deep perineal fascia inferiorly. Its composition divides it into 3 parts: the glans, body, and root. Dorsally, it is composed of the paired corpora cavernosa and ventrally the corpus spongiosum which contains the urethra. The anatomical positions of the penis are according to the erect penis with the dorsal direction being closer to the head and ventral direction being closer to the feet. The tunica albuginea is a fibrous sheet which encapsulates the cavernous body. Buck's fascia, also known as deep fascia of the penis is superficial to the tunica albuginea and is the continuation of the deep perineal fascia which covers the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum together. The spongy urethra is contained within the corpus spongiosum. The crura of the penis is between the 2 corpora cavernosa in the median plane externally. The corpora cavernosa is separated by the septum of the penis internally. The attachment of the penis consists of the bulb, crura, and ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles, which collectively makes up the root of the penis. The bulb of the penis and crura contain erectile tissue. The middle portion of the penis is suspended and known as the body of the penis. The body of the penis lacks muscles and consists mostly of corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and spongy urethra with supporting skin, connective tissue, and blood, lymph, and fascia. The distal part of the penis is known as the glans penis. The proximal portion of the glans is termed the corona. The neck of the corona glans separates it from the body of the penis. The tip of the glans contains the opening to the urethra, known as the meatus. There is loose connective tissue between the thin skin of the penis and the tunica albuginea. The prepuce or foreskin is the second skin layer that covers the glans penis. The frenulum of the prepuce connects it to the urethral surface of the penis glans. The suspensory ligament of the penis is part of the deep fascia that arises from the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis.

{"id": "article-25311_9_1", "question": "How can RGS proteins be targeted for therapy to potentiate opioid effects?", "doc_chunk": "Mu Receptors -- Definition/Introduction -- Receptor Mechanism. Because the enzymatic GTP turnover lasts approximately 2 to 5 minutes, a new signal may find the receptor still not ready to respond. However, the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein speeds up the GTP hydrolysis up to 100-fold. This protein binds the G-alpha subunit and removes the active G-alpha-GTP and beta-gamma species. In turn, RGS works as a negative regulator of GPCR signaling. RGSs are a family of proteins and represent another interesting perspective for targeted therapy, as their specific pharmacological inhibitors could potentiate opioid effects.

The ackee fruit matures into three sections, each consisting of a large black seed and a fleshy yellow aril. The aril, the edible portion of the fruit, initially contains high levels of the toxin hypoglycin. However, over time, as the fruit ripens, the hypoglycin levels drop to ranges allowing for safe human consumption. Toxicity only occurs with ingestion of the unripe Ackee fruit. Differentiating ripe versus unripe Ackee fruit is necessary to prevent any potential adverse health effects. Ripe Ackee fruit may be identified by a yellow-red to red color and wide-open appearance (seeds easily visible). Unripe fruit is green to yellow and has a closed appearance (seeds are difficult to visualize). Cooking an unripe fruit does not reduce its potential for toxicity.

Deglutition or swallowing is an innate function. Swallowing sounds like a simple physiological human function, but it is a complex, multifaceted process involving a variety of muscles and nerves. It is the starting point for the peristaltic transport of food to the stomach. Deglutition in humans can be of three distinct phases: oral phase, pharyngeal phase, and esophageal phase, of which the first one is voluntary, and the other two are reflex actions. The oral phase further divides into an oral preparatory phase and an oral propulsive phase. The location of the food bolus defines each of these phases as it descends towards the stomach. The oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing share anatomy with the respiratory tract, so protection of the airway is of utmost importance. The anatomy of the structures involved in deglutition will be discussed further in this article. [1]", "answer": "3 distinct phases."}

CCK plays a minor role in the release of incretin as compared to glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) from islet cells. Decreased size of islet cells and mass of beta-cells correlates with upregulation of CCK expression and increased sensitivity to CCK for insulin release in obesity. It, therefore, can mediate compensatory mechanisms within the islets of Langerhans. [9] Fat and energy restricted meals stimulate CCK and PP secretion and together with delayed gastric emptying secondary to the intragastric balloon can cause extensive weight loss and improved glucose homeostasis. [12] Presence of CCK in various regions of the midbrain suggests it plays a role in behavioral processes such and anxiety. They describe panic disorder as the feeling of unprovoked fear and an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. People with panic disorder or those that experience panic attacks present to the emergency department feeling a sense of impending doom, chest pain, abdominal pain, sometimes even shortness of breath. We know that CCK is expressed in the nucleus of tractus solitarius and area postrema. They associate these areas with nociception and patients with PD are usually sensitive with bodily sensations.

{"id": "article-30469_18_0", "question": "What is the treatment for a massive air leak during a transhiatal esophagectomy?", "doc_chunk": "Transhiatal Esophagectomy -- Complications. Life-threatening intraoperative complications include bleeding, usually from a large vessel like the azygous vein. Massive bleeding requires packing of the chest and mediastinum and immediate thoracotomy for control of the bleeding vessel. Minor bleeding usually stops with gentle packing and time. Other complications include the massive air leak from a hole in the posterior membranous trachea or bronchus. This is noted intraoperatively as a large air leak, and the inability to ventilate the patient. Treatment of this is immediate recognition, and the surgeon and the anesthesiologist work together to advance the endotracheal tube past the tear and then using a thoracotomy incision, the hole is repaired. If the conduit is not viable because the blood supply has been compromised, then another conduit like the colon should be chosen. Finally, if the conduit will not reach the neck, then either another conduit is chosen, or a thoracotomy performed and the anastomosis placed in the chest. Injuries to one or both recurrent laryngeal nerves are known complications as well. If recognized at the time of injury, the nerve should try to be repaired but is often too small for this. An otolaryngologist (ENT) consult is necessary to assist with this, and a formal tracheostomy may be necessary during the hospital course.", "answer": "The treatment for a massive air leak during a transhiatal esophagectomy involves immediate recognition of the issue, collaboration between the surgeon and the anesthesiologist to advance the endotracheal tube past the tear, and repairing the hole using a thoracotomy incision."}

[29] This disease can present due to mutations in five different subunits of the NADPH oxidase enzyme, the most common being a mutation in the CYBB gene, with X-linked recessive inheritance. [29] Bacterial infections mainly result from Staphyloccocus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella , all of which are catalase-positive organisms. These patients can also develop local or systemic disease after the application of the BCG vaccine. [29] Fungal infections normally result from Aspergillus species. Patients can develop infections in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues, liver, bones, and gastrointestinal tract.

{"id": "article-25912_18_1", "question": "How do ASIC receptors respond to activation by protons?", "doc_chunk": "Physiology, Nociception -- Cellular Level -- Polymodal Nociceptors: Thermal, Mechanical, Chemical. Chemical nociception refers to a nociceptive neuron that expresses receptors capable of detecting noxious, irritating, or harmful chemicals. [3] Since heat-sensitive TRPV receptor proteins are also capable of detecting many noxious chemicals, it should be no surprise that the TRP receptor family also function as chemical receptors. In terms of chemical sensitivity TRPV1 is surpassed by TRPA1, while ‘V' indicated vanilloid, ‘A' simply indicates subfamily A. TRPV1 is capable of binding capsaicin, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and other important pro-inflammatory molecules, however TRPA1 is capable of detecting a wide variety of oily and pungent isothiocyanate compounds such as mustard oils, cinnamaldehyde, and formaldehyde, which is commonly injected to study the activity of TRPA1 receptors, and is even responsible for mediating the stinging, tearful sensations induced by chopping onions or exposure to synthetic tear gases. [1] [2] [3] TRPA1 receptor activation also differs significantly from TRPV1 activation, whereas TRPV1 undergoes a conformational change when bound by its ligand, noxious chemicals bind to TRPA1 via a nucleophilic attack that produces covalent modification of cysteine residues on the intracellular portion of the receptor. [3] Once the intracellular modification has occurred, the receptor opens and depolarizes the neuron. [3] The acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) are another example of a noxious chemical receptor, as their name implies ASICs are stimulated by protons that activate the receptor, inducing their cation channel to open. [5] ASIC receptors are found throughout the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) and are capable of detecting acidic conditions of many different etiologies; these conditions span from the more benign lactic acidosis triggering muscle pain to the more severe acidosis produced by the tissue damage induced by ischemia, stroke, or tumor growth.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_144_1", "question": "Through what structure does each spinal nerve exit the vertebral canal laterally?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. During development, the vertebral column grows much faster than the spinal cord. As a result, the spinal cord does not extend the entire length of the vertebral canal (Fig. 2.11). In the adult, the spinal cord typically ends between vertebrae LI and LII, although it can end as high as vertebra TXII and as low as the disc between vertebrae LII and LIII. Spinal nerves originate from the spinal cord at increasingly oblique angles from vertebrae CI to Co, and the nerve roots pass in the vertebral canal for increasingly longer distances. Their spinal cord level of origin therefore becomes increasingly dissociated from their vertebral column level of exit. This is particularly evident for lumbar and sacral spinal nerves.

{"id": "article-30531_8_1", "question": "What interventions can be used to control hemorrhage in trauma patients?", "doc_chunk": "Trauma Assessment -- Technique or Treatment -- Circulation. The assessment of circulation focuses on hemorrhage control and maintaining adequate perfusion. Hemorrhage has been identified as the most common cause of preventable death in trauma victims. [1] Start by visually evaluating the patient looking for external hemorrhage or signs of shock like pallor. Palpate the patient's carotid and femoral pulses while assessing if the skin is cold and diaphoretic. The patient's mentation can also offer clues to how well they are perfusing their vital organs, but care should be taken to rely on this in patients with a possible head injury. In the presence of external bleeding, control should be attempted by direct pressure. In the case of arterial bleed from an extremity, a tourniquet can be applied. If the patient does not have palpable central pulses, further investigation and intervention are needed. The 5 locations to look for major hemorrhage include the thorax, peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal cavity, pelvic or long bone fractures, and externally. The focused assessment using sonography in trauma (FAST) exam may be used to assess for intra-abdominal hemorrhage. In patients with shock, isotonic intravenous fluids can be initially administered, but blood products are preferred in a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio of red blood cells to plasma to platelets for patients with ongoing fluid requirements and concerns for hemorrhage. [5] [6] Be aware that the trauma victim may be on anticoagulation, and this may need to be reversed. [7] Shock may also be caused by tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or spinal cord injury. The FAST exam and extended FAST exam (includes pulmonary evaluation) also aid in the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade and pneumothorax. Thoracotomy may be performed if an intrathoracic cause of shock is suspected. Establishing adequate IV access in trauma patients is also of critical importance. Two large-bore peripheral IVs, or functioning intraosseous access, should be established early in the evaluation period. Cardiac monitoring should also be established as soon as feasible.", "answer": "Direct pressure, tourniquet application, FAST exam, administration of blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio, reversal of anticoagulation, and establishing vascular access are interventions to control hemorrhage in trauma patients."}

{"id": "article-29723_10_0", "question": "How does superoxide play a role in cell survival?", "doc_chunk": "Biochemistry, Superoxides -- Function. Large amounts of superoxide are produced as the body generates inflammatory NO, leading to increased peroxynitrite concentrations, a cytotoxic mediator molecule. [20] When considerable amounts accumulate in the cells, these play an essential role in cell survival, specifically involving activation or inactivation of G proteins JAK or STAT proteins, NK-kappa B, and MAPK pathways. [20] The formation of hydroxyl radicals can lead to direct DNA damage after oxidative stress. [22] Research has also shown that superoxide can modulate vascular tone, cell growth, gene expression, and signaling in blood vessels. [11] As previously mentioned, superoxide is readily converted to hydrogen peroxide by SODs. Hydrogen peroxide then can undergo reduction to water by the action of glutathione peroxidase or catalase, ridding the cell of possibly dangerous radicals. [22] Glutathione peroxidase converts hydrogen peroxide to water, whereas catalase converts hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_118_1", "question": "What role do fascias play in providing support for tissues?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. In the clinic The importance of fascias A fascia is a thin band of tissue that surrounds muscles, bones, organs, nerves, and blood vessels and often remains uninterrupted as a 3D structure between tissues. It provides important support for tissues and can provide a boundary between structures. Clinically, fascias are extremely important because they often limit the spread of infection and malignant disease. When infections or malignant diseases cross a fascial plain, a primary surgical clearance may require a far more extensive dissection to render the area free of tumor or infection. A typical example of the clinical importance of a fascial layer would be of that covering the psoas muscle. Infection within an intervertebral body secondary to tuberculosis can pass laterally into the psoas muscle. Pus fills the psoas muscle but is limited from further spread by the psoas fascia, which surrounds the muscle and extends inferiorly into the groin pointing below the inguinal ligament.", "answer": "Fascias provide support for tissues by surrounding and supporting muscles, bones, organs, nerves, and blood vessels, and by serving as boundaries between these structures."}

To infiltrate the affected sites, the monocytes must first secure themselves to the endothelium and then loosely roll along the vascular surface. The monocyte then firmly adheres to the endothelium and finally passes through the endothelial cells through a process known as diapedesis. Monocytes are then able to penetrate the endothelial basement membrane and migrate to the area of inflammation. [12] This process occurs through the interaction of molecules on both the monocyte and the endothelial cell surfaces. [13] Growth factors and cytokines determine the monocyte subtype. [14] Monocytes function as phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells in the peripheral blood to ingest and remove microorganisms, foreign material, and dead or damaged cells.

{"id": "article-28076_5_1", "question": "Who coined the term pulsus paradoxus?", "doc_chunk": "Pulsus Paradoxus -- Pathophysiology. To truly understand the pathophysiology of pulsus paradoxus, we must explore the normal respirophasic effects of chest mechanics on blood pressure. In healthy individuals, there are normal phasic changes in cardiac output that occur with respiration. During inspiration, there is a small decrease in systemic arterial pressure of less than 10 mm Hg. As we inhale, intrapleural pressure drops; there is a decrease in intrathoracic pressure that promotes venous inflow into the chest increasing right heart filling. However, this does not equate to an increased filling of the left heart during inspiration. This is because, as one inhales, the lungs expand and pull radial traction on the pulmonary vasculature increasing its capacitance, momentarily sequestering blood in the chest, and dropping blood flow to the left heart, decreasing pre-load and consequently cardiac output. The opposite occurs during expiration, thus systolic pressure normally decreases during inspiration and increases during expiration. So why does the term pulsus paradoxus imply the drop in blood pressure during inspiration is paradoxical? The term pulsus paradoxus was coined by historic German physician Adolph Kussmaul who was referring to the palpated pulse of affected patients being of variable strength despite regular precordial activity.

While empiric use of quinolones is often sufficient to treat patients on an outpatient basis, physicians must follow up with patients to confirm the effectiveness of the treatment and ensure the full completion of their antibiotic course. In cases where culture and sensitivity are available, patients should be placed on more targeted antibiotics to allow for the discontinuation of quinolones.", "answer": "Patients should be placed on more targeted antibiotics instead of quinolones when culture and sensitivity results are available."}

How the osteotomies are performed depends upon the surgeon's preference. It is the author's preference to perform right-angle cuts to remove a rectangular block of bone through the distal and proximal limits of the osteotomies, as opposed to a “canoe boat” or “keel-boat” which is often described. When exposing the bone for osteotomy, care is taken to preserve the periosteum over the bone. The length of the bone to be harvested is delineated. The limits of the bone harvest are the head of the radius distally and the insertion of the pronator teres muscle proximally. Roughly 50% of the height of the radius is identified by visual inspection and palpation with the arm pronated and supinated. A scalpel can be used to incise the periosteum and mark the planned osteotomies. Osteotomies can then be made with the saw along the incised periosteum. Care should be taken during the completion of the vertical osteotomies to avoid pass-cutting into the residual radius.  Doing so can weaken the bone that remains after graft harvest.

In the case of metabolic factors, the damage to myocytes occurs mostly due to the lack of ATP. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is critical to the myocytes, and its levels should be maintained above a certain level to keep the cell viable. The common substrates for ATP production are glycogen and triglycerides. Therefore, any defect in the metabolism of these substrates leads to rhabdomyolysis, especially when the person is involved in ATP requiring activities like strenuous exercise. [6] In addition to the release of myoglobin, during this process of cell death, the myocytes can accumulate large amounts of fluid, which can lead to hypovolemia as well.", "answer": "ATP is essential for maintaining myocyte viability by providing energy to sustain cellular functions, preventing damage and death that contribute to myoglobinuria."}

Only light sedation, if any, is preferred. This procedure can be performed under local anesthetic or by the additional administration of oral valium to help ensure that the patient is relatively comfortable but not heavily sedated since real-time accurate patient feedback is essential. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the nucleus pulposus of each disc to be tested is entered with the smallest gauge needle possible, typically a 22 or 25 gauge spinal needle. The discs are then sequentially pressurized with contrast, and the patient’s response to pressurization of each disc is noted. If pain reproduced is of adequate severity and similar in quality to the patient’s usual spine pain, the test is deemed concordant; however, if the pain produced is dissimilar to the patient's usual spine pain, the test is discordant. PD results are valid if all of the following criteria are satisfied: the patient is alert enough to relate information reliably, manometry is utilized for each disc tested, and a radiographically normal control disc does not produce concordant pain when pressurized.

{"id": "article-24559_18_0", "question": "What are some treatment options for leaks of lymphatic fluid in the thoracic duct?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy, Lymphatic System -- Clinical Significance. Leaks of lymphatic fluid occur when the lymphatic vessels are damaged. In the abdomen, lymphatic vessel damage may occur during surgery, especially during retroperitoneal procedures such as repairing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. These leaks tend to be mild, and the vessels in the peritoneum and mesentery eventually absorb the lymphatic fluid or chyle. However, when the thoracic duct is injured in the chest, the chyle leak can be extensive. In most cases, conservative care with a no-fat diet (medium chain triglycerides) or total parenteral nutrition is unsuccessful. In most cases, if the injury to the thoracic duct was surgical, a surgical procedure is required to tie off the duct. If the thoracic duct is injured in the cervical region, then inserting a drainage tube and adopting a low-fat diet will help seal the leak. However, thoracic duct injury in the chest cavity usually requires drainage and surgery. It is rare for the thoracic segment of the thoracic duct to seal on its own.

{"id": "article-21960_32_2", "question": "Why is it important to maintain the integrity of the paratenons during the elevation of the distal skin island in an osteocutaneous radial forearm flap procedure?", "doc_chunk": "Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Flap -- Technique or Treatment. At this point, the skin island of the flap can be elevated off the muscles of the forearm. If there is any concern at the start of the procedure of a non-viable distal extremity, an intraoperative Allen test can be performed by placing an Acland clamp on the radial artery at the distal wrist and releasing the tourniquet. This test demonstrates the conditions of ulnar-only artery flow to the hand. If there is a clinical suggestion of ischemia, the flap is aborted. Of course, this test can be done at any time during the procedure, based on the surgeon’s preference. If the surgeon is otherwise confident about the hand’s ability to perfuse the ulnar artery alone, the procedure can be continued by ligating the distal venae comitantes and the radial artery. A silk suture is used to ligate the radial artery with a long tail placed on the flap side to facilitate observation of pulsations in the distal flap after the tourniquet is released and after microvascular anastomosis is completed. With the pedicle, the distal skin island is elevated off the tendons of the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis, taking care to maintain the integrity of the paratenons in order to prevent the tendons from adhering to the skin graft postoperatively.", "answer": "To prevent the tendons from adhering to the skin graft postoperatively."}

The diaphragm is not flat; rather, it “balloons” superiorly, on both the right and left sides, to form domes. The right dome is higher than the left, reaching as far as rib V. As the diaphragm contracts, the height of the domes decreases and the volume of the thorax increases. The esophagus and inferior vena cava penetrate the diaphragm; the aorta passes posterior to the diaphragm.", "answer": "esophagus, inferior vena cava, aorta"}

The failure to consider other potential structures that may produce back pain can lead to significant mortality and morbidity. Pain may refer to the back from a number of organs situated in the retroperitoneum. Pancreatic pain in particular refers to the back and may be associated with pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis. Renal pain, which may be produced by stones in the renal collecting system or renal tumors, also typically refers to the back. More often than not this is usually unilateral; however, it can produce central posterior back pain. Enlarged lymph nodes in the preand para-aortic region may produce central posterior back pain and may be a sign of solid tumor malignancy, infection, or Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is characterized by vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait disturbances with an acute onset (seconds to hours), which are associated with nystagmus and head-motion intolerance (days to weeks). Etiology can either be peripheral, most commonly vestibular neuritis, or central, such as brainstem or cerebellar stroke. Vestibular neuritis is usually viral in origin and self-limiting, while a central stroke can have permanent effects. Therefore, it is critical to distinguish between these two etiologies to ensure proper patient care. This can be done at the bedside using the “Head-Impulse—Nystagmus—Test-of-Skew” (HINTS) exam. The horizontal head-impulse test, which assesses the vestibulo-ocular reflex, would be normal with central etiologies and abnormal with peripheral etiologies. Nystagmus would be vertical and/or bidirectional with central etiologies and unidirectional with peripheral etiologies, regardless of gaze direction. Skew deviation would be present with central etiologies and absent with peripheral etiologies.

The surgical and endovascular treatment options were explained to the patient. Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been, for many years, an operative procedure where the dilation (ballooning) of the aorta is resected and a graft is sewn into position. A modern option is to place a graft to line the aneurysm from within the artery (endovascular aneurysm repair). In this technique the surgeon dissects the femoral artery and makes a small hole in it. The graft is compressed within a catheter and the catheter is passed through the femoral artery and the iliac arterial system into the distal abdominal aorta. The graft can then be released inside the aorta, effectively relining it to prevent further expansion of the aneurysm. Occasionally the relined aneurysm may continue to enlarge after the endovascular graft has been placed and a cause needs to be identified.", "answer": "Endovascular aneurysm repair differs from traditional operative procedures in that it uses a less invasive method, inserting a graft via a catheter through the femoral artery to line the aneurysm from within, rather than resecting the aneurysm and sewing a graft into place."}

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_856_0", "question": "How does an umbilical hernia differ from a para-umbilical hernia?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Umbilical hernias are rare. Occasionally, they are congenital and result from failure of the small bowel to return to the abdominal cavity from the umbilical cord during development. After birth, umbilical hernias may result from incomplete closure of the umbilicus (navel). Overall, most of these hernias close in the first year of life, and surgical repair is not generally attempted until later. Para-umbilical hernias may occur in adults at and around the umbilicus and often have small necks, so requiring surgical treatment. Incisional hernias occur through a defect in a scar of a previous abdominal operation. Usually, the necks of these hernias are wide and do not therefore strangulate the viscera they contain. A spigelian hernia passes upward through the arcuate line into the lateral border at the lower part of the posterior rectus sheath.

The defining histopathologic feature of progressive supranuclear palsy is an intracerebral aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau with preferential involvement of the subthalamic nucleus, pallidum, striatum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, pontine tegmentum, oculomotor nucleus, medulla, and dentate nucleus. [3] The aggregates predominantly contain tau isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats (4R-tau) in neurofibrillary tangles, oligodendrocytic coils, and astrocytic tufts. [4] [22] [23] Normally, tau is phosphorylated on a series of serine and threonine residues, regulated by numerous kinases and phosphatases. In progressive supranuclear palsy and other tauopathies, the tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, which causes it to lose its affinity for microtubules and become resistant to proteolysis. This results in the accumulation of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. [24] Definite diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy currently requires neuropathological examination.

The second covering is formed by the musculature of the internal oblique (a covering from the transversus abdominis muscle is not acquired because the processus vaginalis passes under the arching fibers of this abdominal wall muscle). Its most superficial covering is the aponeurosis of the external oblique. As a result the processus vaginalis is transformed into a tubular structure with multiple coverings from the layers of the anterior abdominal wall. This forms the basic structure of the inguinal canal. The final event in this development is the descent of the testes into the scrotum or of the ovaries into the pelvic cavity.

The procedure is performed in the operating room, with anesthesia providing sedation, and some surgeons may prefer general anesthesia. The patient is placed either in a prone or lithotomy position depending on the anticipated tract and its source anterior or posterior in the anus. If the anticipated tract is anterior in the anus, then prone is preferred and the lithotomy position for the posterior midline tracts. This positioning makes the internal opening more visible for the surgeon and the tract more accessible. The fistula probe (lacrimal duct probes) are usually required to explore the tract and its trajector, and most of the time, with chronic fistulas, the probe can be used to find the internal opening easily. If the tract is difficult to locate, then hydrogen peroxide can be injected gently in the external opening (utilizing the syringe with angiocatheter to enter the external opening), and with an anal retractor, the peroxide can be seen bubbling from the internal opening. This maneuver allows the surgeon to demonstrate where the tract would be using the probe. [9] Once the tract has the probe through it, then a vessel loop, a heavy 1 nylon suture, or a thick rubber band can be attached to the probe and brought through the tract. Both ends of the Seton are sewn together in a couple of areas close together, so the loop to prevent it from falling out. If a cutting seton is selected, then the Seton is gradually tightened externally over weeks. If a non-cutting seton is utilized, the Seton is usually fashioned from a vessel loop or other smooth non-reactive product and left loose. If the tract cannot be located, the surgeon should not force a tract at the risk of creating a false tract. If the tract cannot be located, the surgeon may work to unroof the external opening as close to the anal verge as possible and make plans for a repeat anorectal examination under anesthesia in the operating room in the following weeks. In the meantime, the surgeon may opt for a CT scan or MRI of the pelvis with rectal contrast to see if the tract can be identified.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_2268_0", "question": "How does the ciliary muscle contribute to accommodation for near vision?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. The ciliary muscle consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged longitudinally, circularly, and radially. Controlled by parasympathetics traveling to the orbit in the oculomotor nerve [III], these muscle fibers, on contraction, decrease the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. The ciliary processes are longitudinal ridges projecting from the inner surface of the ciliary body (Fig. 8.110). Extending from them are zonular fibers attached to the lens of the eyeball, which suspend the lens in its proper position and collectively form the suspensory ligament of the lens. Contraction of the ciliary muscle decreases the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. This reduces tension on the suspensory ligament of the lens. The lens therefore becomes more rounded (relaxed) resulting in accommodation of the lens for near vision.

{"id": "Anatomy_Gray_667_0", "question": "What are the two types of nerve fibers that innervate the peritoneum?", "doc_chunk": "Anatomy_Gray. Innervation of the peritoneum The parietal peritoneum associated with the abdominal wall is innervated by somatic afferents carried in branches of the associated spinal nerves and is therefore sensitive to well-localized pain. The visceral peritoneum is innervated by visceral afferents that accompany autonomic nerves (sympathetic and parasympathetic) back to the central nervous system. Activation of these fibers can lead to referred and poorly localized sensations of discomfort, and to reflex visceral motor activity. The peritoneal cavity is subdivided into the greater sac and the omental bursa (lesser sac; Fig. 4.54). The greater sac accounts for most of the space in the peritoneal cavity, beginning superiorly at the diaphragm and continuing inferiorly into the pelvic cavity. It is entered once the parietal peritoneum has been penetrated.", "answer": "Somatic afferents and visceral afferents."}

Mutations of SOD1 resulting in a decrease of 50 to 80% of function have correlated with the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neural disorder that causes motor neuron death in the spinal cord and brain, that results in mixed upper and lower motor neuron symptoms and gradually leads to paralysis of the entire body. [32] The decrease in SOD function leads to a toxic increase in superoxide concentrations in neurons. [32] Superoxide also plays an important role in pain sensation and hyperalgesia, mediated by upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and increases TNF-alpha to sensitize nociceptive neurons. [33] Various reports imply that oxidative species are essential in the immortalization of specific epithelial cells, given that these exhibited greater levels of intracellular oxidant stress than nonmalignant cells. [23] This evidence supports the idea that oxidative species contribute to the survival and proliferation of cancer cells.

During expiration, it contracts to assist in elevating the domes of the diaphragm, thus reducing thoracic volume. Material can be expelled from the airway by forced expiration using the abdominal muscles, as in coughing or sneezing. Contraction of abdominal wall muscles can dramatically increase intraabdominal pressure when the diaphragm is in a fixed position (Fig. 4.4).

If the openings of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery become narrowed, the blood supply to the gut is diminished. After a heavy meal, the oxygen demand of the bowel therefore outstrips the limited supply of blood through the stenosed vessels, resulting in severe pain and discomfort (mesenteric angina). Patients with this condition tend not to eat because of the pain and rapidly lose weight. The diagnosis is determined by aortic angiography, and the stenoses of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery are best appreciated in the lateral view. In the clinic Cirrhosis is a complex disorder of the liver, the diagnosis of which is confirmed histologically. When a diagnosis is suspected, a liver biopsy is necessary. Cirrhosis is characterized by widespread hepatic fibrosis interspersed with areas of nodular regeneration and abnormal reconstruction of preexisting lobular architecture.

Spontaneous voiding is the simplest and most commonly used method in clinical practice. Before collecting the sample, health personnel should be provided clear instructions to patients in order to minimize the chance of contamination from penile/vaginal microbiota (“clean-catch” method). Most urine collection kits include a sterile container with a lid and sterile moist towels to wipe the urethral area before collection; if not, cotton wool or toilet tissue and/or tap water with soap may be used. Traditionally, male patients are instructed to retract the foreskin and clean the glans of the penis before urinating. Consequently, females should clean the labia and urethral meatus as well before collection. Currently, it is under debate the need for these standard precautions, and even many areas no longer perform them.

A rare type of congenital heart disease is an interrupted aortic arch (IAA), which affects approximately 1.5% of congenital heart disease patients. Interrupted aortic arch is an anomaly that can be considered the most severe form of aortic coarctation. In an IAA, there is an anatomical and luminal disruption between the ascending and descending aorta. IAA is a ductus dependent lesion since this is the only way the blood flow can travel to places distal to the disruption. This activity reviews the presentation of the interrupted aortic arch and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.", "answer": "1.5%"}
