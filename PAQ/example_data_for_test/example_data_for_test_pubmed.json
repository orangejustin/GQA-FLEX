Novel prophylactic possibilities]. A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104. Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1.

    "doc_chunk": "Formation of transient complexes in the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction. The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.",

The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.",

The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein.

The purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 units/mg and is homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and titration with methotrexate. The products of the first step of Edman degradation indicated a minimum purity of 79%. The reductase has a molecular weight of about 21500 on the basis of amino acid composition and 22100 +/- 300 from equilibrium sedimentation. It is not inhibited by antiserum to the Streptococcus faecium reductase (isoenzyme 2). Unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues, the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than activated and it has a single pH optimum at both low and high ionic strength. However, the position of the pH optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength. Automatic Edman degradation has been used to determine 34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues. Considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from S. faecium and from Escherichia coli. This strengthens the idea that this region contributes to the structure of the binding site for dihydrofolate.",

Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RT 500) using a procedure that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography. Determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition, sedimentation velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of 17680, 17470 and 18300, respectively. An aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer. Also, multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are observed in buffers containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7), the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30 degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH optimum of pH 4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is 1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation.

Kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and 15Cl nuclear magnetic resonance at 5.88 MHz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme, renal dipeptidase.

Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions. One anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site. Cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule. An investigation of the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8. Complete dissociation of this group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozinc(II).

    "doc_chunk": "Conformational changes induced in a homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibody by oligosaccharides of increasing size. The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur. Small monovalent ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes attributed to the Fc portion.

The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur.

However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions.

The reduction of metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetate (FeCDTA2-) has been investigated. The equilibrium constant, measured spectrophotometrically, is 0.21 with a resulting reduction potential of 0.050 V for Mb0. The rate constant for the reduction is 28 M-1 sec-1 with a deltaH ++ of 13 kcal M-1 and deltaS ++ of -11 eu. Both CN- and OH- inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low reactivity of cyanometmyoglobin (Mb+CN-) and ionized metmyglobin (Mb+OH-). The rate constant for the reduction of Mb+CN- by FeCDTA2- is 4.0 X 10(-2) M-1 sec-1 and that for reduction of Mb+OH- is 4.8 M-1 sec-1. The nitric oxide complex of metmyoglobin is reduced with a rate constant of 10 M-1 sec-1. The kinetics of oxidation of oxymyoglobin by FeCDTA- were studied. The data are consistent with a mechanism where oxidation takes place entirely through the deoxy form.

The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes. The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. The molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000, respectively. The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [3H]nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes. The binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail. The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane. Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H]Veratridine binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites.

    "question": "What happens to total phosphorylase activity in conditions of prolonged starvation and diabetes?",
    "doc_chunk": "Characteristics of the dephosphorylated form of phosphorylase purified from rat liver and measurement of its activity in crude liver preparations. The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan : orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of AMP. We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes.",

Two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases, GTP:casein kinase I and GTP:casein kinase II, have been purified 29 000- and 47 000-fold, respectively. Studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S). These enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor. Among various protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated casein greater than phosvitin. Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors. Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl. Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at pH 9.0. The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5) M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein. The incorporation of the terminal phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In addition, NaF and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the activity of both kinases. The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is interesting and suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in the red blood cells.",

A purification procedure for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from muscle of the monke35--170 muequiv H+/mg protein per min at 30 degrees C and a yield of approx. 0.5 g/kg muscle. Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions. Kinetic constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the enzyme-second substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species. Inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products. SO4(2-) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group. Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transition-state complex. These anions stabilize the dead-end complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group. The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis. The dead-end complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by iodoacetamide. Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection. The essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme. Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture.

Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-25.

The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems.

    "doc_chunk": "Effects of membrane ribonuclease and 3'-nucleotidase on the digestion of polyuridylic acid by rat liver plasma membrane. 1. Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at pH 7.8 in the presence of 10 mM EDTA can digest polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)). Under these conditions, the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured DNA. 2. The products of the reaction with poly(U) (10 mM EDTA present) can be separated on DEAE-Sephadex into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length. Most of the products are di- to hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups. 3. When EDTA is not present (pH 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and poly(U). With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are produced. 4. The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml). 5.

The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids, using deoxycholate. This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively.

    "doc_chunk": "Inhibitory postsynaptic actions of taurine, GABA and other amino acids on motoneurons of the isolated frog spinal cord. The actions of glycine, GABA, alpha-alanine, beta-alanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated spinal cord of the frog. All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine.

The adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in Azotobacter vinelandii concentrates in the membranous R3 fraction that is directly associated with Azotobacter electron transport function. Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction. Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation.",
